"I?m at a loss. I made it through 9/11, Super Storm Sandy and the Great Recession. Under Obama, I recovered. Trump?s tax laws brought my profession down again. Working 3 jobs now, an employer who promised to stick with us, sent this today on Sunday afternoon. ?I hope that you and your family are staying healthy and safe during this unprecedented time. Given the current circumstances due to COVID-19, I?m going to have to suspend all my business activities indefinitely, including all employment. I sincerely hope, as I?m sure everyone does, that this terrible situation is over quickly and we can resume our work.?

"I'm 76 years old. How incredibly selfish it would be to wish for a nationwide shut down for the next 6 months to increase my chances of living. My life, at this age, means nothing compared with the tragic economic suffering of millions of my fellow Americans.",NYT Picks,NC
"I have zero faith that anyone even remotely attached to the Trump administration has even the faintest idea of what to do. We're well past the initial, highly important, testing phase that could have lessened the impact of this crisis because of Trump's ineptitude and ignorance. This health threat isn't going away in two weeks and it's just wishful thinking that we as a country will be back on track anytime soon. Closing down the economy for a month, sheltering in place for a month, and testing huge swaths of the urban population is not overreaction, it just makes sense. In the best case scenario only thousands will die, in the worst case hundreds of thousands, perhaps more, will die. The cost to the economy is whatever it will take to beat this.",NYT Picks,SC 
"The Katz/ vertical plan has a serious flaw: Many American households are multi-generational (especially lower income ones and minorities) with seniors living under the same roof, or have family members with underlying medical issus that make them vulnerable. What happens after two weeks when mom and dad, along with the kids, are symptom free and return to work and school but grandmother or a family member on chemotherapy still are at home? What happens to this populartion?",NYT Picks,Utah
"No need to alter the approach except to protect known at risk individuals. Americans are incapable of following a directive, especially if it is mostly to benefit someone else. The bulk of the American people have voted selfishly for 40 years and they will act selfishly now. The best you can do is lockdown and then let what happens happen. It will pass fairly fast because Americans will continue to spread it fast. It will also kill a lot of people, but that is the American way, rugged and careless individuals that they are. Just kidding about the rugged part. No way you don't have 6-18 months of dire case loads and economic issues. The economy is not coming back anyway, because it was always fake and built on baby-brained consumers.",NYT Picks,PA
"The best hope for rescuing our economy is through testing. Yes, we need to be manufacturing masks and ventilators, mobilizing health care teams toward a surge in intensive care needs and preparing new beds in make-shift hospitals, but even more importantly we should have all hands on deck to ramp up our ability to test - now. When we can test almost anyone for active infection, and then when we can test health care workers and others at risk for immunity (much later, if ever), then we can start to isolate intelligently. Only then can we move away from the blind indiscriminate quarantine we have now. Later, when we identify some antivirals, or other meds that might rescue the infected from the most severe illness, and then even later when we have a vaccine, life will return to normal. But the best way to move society back to a more normal economic footing is to test, test, test.",NYT Picks,CA
"This is brilliant and important, but also obvious, and it?s shocking to see so-called leaders taking such a blunt and overkill approach currently, with no clear plan, which will do so much more harm to society than the virus over time. True leaders make difficult and sometimes unpopular decisions for the overall good, which of course is challenging in this environment, but is rarely more important than it is now ? to accept that some people will (unavoidably and unfortunately) die but those with a high chance of survival should be able to return to work after two weeks and support the system and others (assuming that proper testing and tracking are available) for the long term benefit of society. It?s frustrating that this debate hasn?t received more attention but I agree it is desperately and urgently needed.",NYT Picks,NY
"Once this virus is contained, let us pressure our elected officials to pass a Green New Deal. That would put a lot of people back to work in good-paying jobs and address this climate crisis: installing solar panel, wind turbines and green roofs, insulating buildings, expanding mass transit, building bike trails, planting trees and growing food with restorative agriculture. Let this coronavirus crisis awaken more to that other great existential threat called climate change, which if unaddressed with the urgency it requires will devastate us even more.",NYT Picks,US
"A society that cared about all of its members equally would ensure that those who are forced to stay home and lose their incomes/jobs are compensated for their bearing the brunt of protecting all of the rest of us. It is a flaw in our dog-eat-dog capitalism model that we are willing to tolerate so much suffering (and such negative health outcomes) for those who lose their jobs. This should be a wakeup call for us as a society: those whose jobs are displaced by superior technology, whether coal miners, auto manufacturers, truck drivers, or data analysts have similarly done us all a service by continuing to do work that needs to be done up until such time as it obsolesces. Unemployment (for whatever reason) should not mean that one's children starve or lack for opportunity.",NYT Picks,NY
"I like the general theme proposed, but like many others, question it's feasibility, given the present shortages of key equipment: testing, ventilators, masks, testing, etc. Which doesn't take away from the validity of the proposal, that it's very worth considering, but that perhaps we must wait another week or two (or more) until it can be put in effect.",NYT Picks,WI 
"As a nation, we have blindly walked into wet cement by insisting upon maintaining a system in which many have no heath insurance, many others are covered only as long as they stay employed, and tens of millions of working Americans live only a few dollars from bankruptcy. Like catching a disease, these disasters come about through little or no fault of the victims; they are the inevitable consequences of the system we have built. It?s a catastrophe of our own making, mainly because we have been indoctrinated into having a greater fear of the mythical dangers of Socialism (falsely sold as a synonym for Communist Stalinism) than of the real life consequences of winner-take-all capitalism. No amount of social planning can completely protect us from catching something virulent, but as it stands we have made one of life?s risks much worse than it needs to be. Once the pandemic passes, and before the next one sweeps the globe, perhaps it is time for the survivors to grow up.",NYT Picks,
"At a time when hospitals are desperate for basic supplies like masks, gowns, and swabs - not to mention ventilators - to treat those who already are seriously ill or dying, your suggestion that we ""let many of us get the coronavirus"" sounds like a prescription for ""dying in place."" Yes, a targeted approach to mitigating the spread of COVID-19 would be desirable in an ideal world. But we do not - at least not now - enjoy that luxury. We might have had better options weeks back, had our leaders not sat on their hands. Instead of calling for swift action, they called their stock brokers. Relaxing the practice of social distance will surely overwhelm an already dismal situation in our health care system.",NYT Picks,Missouri
"Talk about pie in the sky. As stated, the opportunity for a more targeted approach has already passed, thanks largely to the federal government's failure to sound the alarm sooner. The idea that we can quickly figure out why some young people sicken and die from Covid-19 is another nonstarter. It's a new virus and we won't have answers to questions like that for months or more. Having people continue to work in hotels, restaurants, etc. is not going to accomplish anything. People are scared and demand for most things, including hospitality and dining, has collapsed. Workers need customers to service. Without customers, employers can't pay to keep workers on the job. That's economics 101. Meanwhile the virus will spread further while people are at work with no customers (or not enough of them) coming through the door. The only solution, given the failure to respond earlier, is to shut down the country and print money for a couple of months, or even longer if necessary. Not a good solution, but the only one now available. Trying now what might have been workable two months ago is a recipe for disaster.",NYT Picks,VT
"My wife is a nurse in San Francisco- can't even get a straight answer about how many N95 masks are available. Different hospitals have different ideas if its even airborn or not.... How are you going to organize the whole country to ""follow the rules"" and get back to work. When the most vulnerable first responders aren't even being properly protected?",NYT Picks,CA
"Set aside whether you agree or disagree with the plan espoused in this column. We can agree that it is complex and requires leadership and intelligence. Now remember who is president of the US and ask yourself if he and his team are capable of leadership and intelligence. Having read a lot of these ""contrarian"" takes on the crisis over the past week, my conclusion is that the first thing the contrarians such as Friedman need to do is to call for Donald Trump to resign. There's absolutely no possibility of achieving Friedman's ""smart"" virus plan while Trump is in charge. As long as they don't call for his resignation, and as long as he doesn't resign, we're stuck with the state by state shutdown strategy.",NYT Picks,CA
"I appreciate Mr. Friedman's attempt to broaden the conversation but, speaking as a Harvard trained epidemiologist, there are so many problems with what he wrote that I found this more misleading than helpful. Just one (of many) puzzling comments in this editorial: Dr. Steven Woolf, director emeritus of the Center on Society and Health at Virginia Commonwealth University, shared with me some thoughts he was hammering into an essay: ?Society?s response to Covid-19, such as closing businesses and locking down communities, may be necessary to curb community spread but could harm health in other ways, costing lives. Imagine a patient with chest pain or a developing stroke, where speed is essential to save lives, hesitating to call 911 for fear of catching the coronavirus. Or a cancer patient having to delay chemotherapy because the facility is closed. Or a patient with advanced emphysema who dies for lack of a facility with a ventilator.?? How would NOT closing businesses and trying to limit community spread result in seriously ill individuals feeling safer about calling 911? Where is the evidence that chemotherapy is being delayed due to facilities being closed? That's like saying hospitals are part of the mandated business closings. Ah, I don't think so. Individuals with advanced emphysema are MORE likely not to have a ventilator if we don't slow down infections and take the burden off the health care system. Very disappointing article.",Reader Picks,MA
"But, we did not have testing available when it was most needed because the administration decided not to accept testing from WHO. We do not have adequate testing now. 40% or more of infections are in those under 50 and some of these die, so it is not the flu. Herd immunity requires about 70% of the population to have contacted the virus or been immunized with a vaccine. Natural herd immunity has a steep curve that will kill hundreds of thousands. Vaccination is at least 12 months away. Yes, we should have had testing available so we could have isolated those at serious risk of dying (nursing homes, retirement communities, elderly workers , etc) but we did not and now we have vectors all over the US with little or no testing available to determine which of the high risk people are infected or which of the low risk people can go back to work in a non-infected work place. We lost the chance to contain the economic disaster we are now entering because of incompetent, intentional, poor governance from a republican party that has wanted to shrink the government until it could be drowned in a bathtub for the past 40 years. The republican party is now killing the US population instead. We will get through this, but the republican party needs to pay a high price. They need to go the way of the Whigs.",Reader Picks,montana
I make $14/hr. No benefits. Really not hurrying back to that...for the economy's sake or mine.,Reader Picks,IL 
@mitchell Exactly this. Until we have wide spread testing everywhere available to literally everyone we can't just go back to business as usual. We need to test people as frequently as needed to isolate infected asymptomatic cases as soon as possible to decrease the infection rate. Then and only then life can go back. Otherwise this disease will keep coming and hitting in waves.,Reader Picks,IL 
"You are not paying attention. The only way we could have gone back to work quickly would have been massive testing as soon as the corona virus arrived in America. We missed that opportunity. Of course people want to go back to work, but be realistic. Don't you have some responsibility as a columnist to promote a realistic assessment of the facts? Based on what is happening in other countries, we may not be at 'peak corona' until early- to mid-May. If everyone leaves self-isolation without testing, then asymptomatic people who have the virus will give it to others, and the process will start again. This whole mess could have been avoided by massive early testing. But the president said it wasn't serious.",Reader Picks,CO
"This crisis is striking at the frailest part of America: Our identity. For two centuries, we?ve been fed a diet of propaganda that we?ve all frontiersmen and rugged individualists, and nothing can abrogate that. Whatever threatens our ?I?m going my way? ethos is the enemy, from Native Americans to terrorists. We?ll draw our trusty six-shooters, saddle up, and yee-haw our way to victory. Except that the terrorists this time require that we think as a collective, that we drop our cherished pretense as one of 300,000,000 people going our own way, and start going the same way together, or else. We?re not cowboys or frontiersmen. We?re neighbors and coworkers who need to think like a Union, not a loose collection of states. That?s the primary failing of Trump; he?s spinning a romantic trope -me first, I?m an American ? that is counterproductive at least, and deadly at worst.

"Not a word here or anywhere about taxing all billionaires out of existence, as we should?ve done long ago, to pay for all this? Humanity can no longer afford billionaires. Put an immediate 90% tax on everything over 1 billion, and if they no longer feel they have incentive, they can go work at a hospital where they might actually do some good. Ownership is productive of nothing on its own. A person making 50 K a year could survive for 20,000 years on just 1 billion. Tough luck if they can?t be comfortable for the rest of their life with just that amount. Shameful that they all aren?t offering to pay for as much as they can right now.",Reader Picks,Wisconsin

"No, the cure is not worse than the disease. Dead people cannot spend money. It's that simple. Only a 1% fatality rate? There's no such thing as ""only"" 1% of human beings. 1% of 7.7 billion is 77 million. That's 77 MILLION human lives. Consider the following: 1. COVID-19 is not the flu. It is at least 5 times as deadly, it is more transmissible, it has a higher incubation period, and it randomly kills healthy individuals. 2. Because of the high incubation period, self-isolating after symptoms develop is simply too late. 3. Allowing it to spread will allow more strains of COVID-19 to develop, potentially making it impossible to vaccinate against. 4. If COVID-19 becomes a seasonal illlness like the flu, the mortality will be largely additive ? every year, some people would die from the flu, and others from COVID-19 (or some strain of it). Let's talk about the economic impact of an additional 150,000 annual deaths! 5. Our economy isn't actually grinding to a comple halt. Many people ? Friedman included ? are able to work remotely. 6. Without drastic action, virtually everyone will get this illness. 7. If we can't flatten the curve, our health care system will be overwhelmed and the death toll will be much worse than 1%. 8. It's impossible to fully isolate the most vulnerable because they are cared for by the less vulnerable. Friedman may think some humans can be sacrificied for the good of the economy, but the economy IS human beings, and we're all in this together.",Reader Picks,NY
"It is always questionable to form a strategy based on one or two opinions, even if those are expert opinions. Criticism of Ioannidis from others, including epideiologists, is all over the web and may be for Katz, though I haven?t checked. Science works by concensus, not lone mavericks, in spite of a great deal of fiction that passes for science. The bottom line is that we have missed the testing, testing, testing boat so badly that all we can do now is flail around in a rather haphazard effort to contain.",Reader Picks,Canada
"We are united as an industry and speaking with one voice,? the chief executives of major airlines, UPS and FedEx said in a letter to congressional leaders on Saturday. ?We urge you to swiftly pass a bipartisan bill with worker payroll protections to ensure that we can save the jobs of our 750,000 airline professionals,? wrote the group, which included the heads of Southwest Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines and American Airlines. If Congress approves at least $29 billion in grants for the industry, the executives said they would commit to no furloughs or layoffs through August. If an equal amount in loans is passed, they would commit to limiting executive compensation and freezing stock buybacks and dividends for the life of the loan."" The above is from another article. What galls me is the airlines WERE PREVIOUSLY BAILED OUT. They were irresponsible and didn't save for a rainy day. They were fiscal TODDLERS. Living in the short term. Now it looks to me that they are attempting to wield their influence in the POLICY REALM. They are unelected. They squandered reserves with executive pay, stock buy backs and shareholder dividends. Now, I don't care if they fail. Let them. Unless, they change to less carbon intensive practices, they are still polluters and we still ultimately pay the price of their greed and recklessness as citizens of a global society.",Reader Picks,NM
"These are the musings of someone with first-rate health insurance and the affluence and social prominence to obtain the best of medical care on top of that. There is simply no practical means to ""sequester"" the most vulnerable, especially with a rapidly moving virus that will doubtless itself be the best determiner of who is and who is not the most vulnerable. That would entail ripping apart families and communities. We don't all live in separate nuclear-family homes, our kids and parents in homes of their own, or age-sorted, gated communities. Even if we did manage to sequester many of the vulnerable, that would still leave the poor bearing the brunt of the consequences of this basically cruel and indifferent herd inoculation scheme. It's not so much a plan as an argument for immediate capitulation to what ""nature"" will do if left alone, in order to save the grotesquely unequal structure of our current economy from any more disruption or the challenge that might arise from too long having to provide support to the general populace that looks an awful lot like Andrew Yang's Universal Basic Income and Bernie Sander's Medicare For All. In short, this is Tom Friedman sinking to a low I previously did not imagine him capable of reaching.

"So easy to say when you can bloviate from home. Other people don't want to put themselves at risk. 1% is merely a statistical value to you, but that represents millions of lives killed needlessly (in the U.S. alone, potentially more Americans killed than in WWII). This is not a war where civilians should be drafted to die for the sake of your 401k; for the sake of Capitalism. We should take the unprecedented wealth of this country, stop pretending our jobs matter (those non-essential jobs which have been shuttered because of the virus), and use that excess wealth to give everyone healthcare, housing, and a universal basic income. It's time to shift this economy to the 21st century. Mother nature sent us to our room to think about what we've done. Trying to ""get back to normal"" misses the point entirely.

There isn't enough money? Great Britain is looking at paying people up to 80% of their salaries to stay at home.

"Thanks, Mr. President, for refusing to act when first told in January of the virus being here. Thanks for calling it a 'democratic' hoax' and 'fake news' while the virus was starting to spread. Thanks for refusing the World Health Organization's testing kits, while the virus was spreading at an increasing rate. We are dead last in testing per capita, thanks to that 'decision'. Thanks for refusing to deploy our military to build hospitals, and refusing to act on the defense powers act to get critical medical supplies and equipment to our health care providers. Counties like South Korea, Japan and Singapore did the complete opposite. They acted right away, didn't lie to their citizens, and starting widespread testing quickly. They had their first cases on the exact day as we did, or within a few days, and today have the virus completely contained, with virtually no new cases, without shutting down their economies. We, on the other hand, have to go on complete lock down, and given how out of control the virus is spreading, will go on for months, if not the rest of the year.

If, after a return to normal work patterns, people will monitor their interactions and personal habits (handshakes, handwashing, etc.). 5. If immunity is, in fact, acquired after an infection has run its course. When will we have an answer to this? 6. If we can establish the reasons why some young people have been killed by the virus.

There is an unspoken but ever present value placed on the economic system but not on the many souls who work without healthcare so that others can be paid more and the businesses themselves retain more in profit. In a pandemic the societal/community value of all that ?under work? suddenly rises to the surface and we see how all our lives are actually interconnected and none is left out, however small. It then becomes a question of saving the society and the individual workers not just the schema of business. Friedman et al. seem to have missed this lesson and operate in their own silos. Trump isn?t operational at all, which is how we got to this point. In a manner of speaking we are about to become the next Trump bankruptcy.",Reader Picks,NY
"What every country needs - especially the slow kid kid in the class, Trump's America - is a bumper crop of face masks, fever thermometers, personal protective equipment, ventilators, test kits and 14-day quarantine....none of it is rocket science.

See Italy, Spain, etc. for further evidence. Not sure what's so hard to understand about rebooting the economy when more masks and ventilators and healthy helpers are on hand. Why is Friedman and others at this time talking about the economy as if it can't be changed? After all, the economic structure of this country has led to some of the issues we're dealing with right now. So why back to business as usual? Odd.",Reader Picks,Norway

"First we blew mass testing. Then we did the same with masks, and PPEs. Now we?re down to trying to get ahead of the final stage, with ventilators. Without a war-time type effort to respond, we?ve been consistently late on all fronts. The economic recovery will have to wait. Mass testing and tracing would still make a big difference if we got in the game in a timely manner. That does not appear to be occurring.",Reader Picks,IL 
"And as to the arguments that Friedman, Ioannidis, and Katz have espoused--arguments that I think do have merit, inasmuch as it is likely, according to the recent Columbia model and others, that there may be ten to twelve unknown COVID-19 infections for each one that is known, but the overwhelming majority of these are not severe or even asymptomatic, meaning the actual mortality rate is much lower than the most common figures currently mentioned--we could discuss them a lot more seriously in a better resourced health system that had testing, ventilators, and personal protective equipment more readily available. It's certainly true that the dithering incompetence of our current administration has led us into a bigger hole than was necessary--especially when we contrast with South Korea or Taiwan's responses. But given where we are, we will need at least four weeks of pretty good global isolation to slow transmission. At that point, we may be able to go with just isolating the most vulnerable--and, of course, we do need to determine just what the characteristics of the most vulnerable are. Still, this should not be a wasted opportunity. Our situation radically demonstrates the need for a much augmented safety net. Everyone should have sick time. Everyone should have access to health care paid mostly through progressive taxation, not income ability. And Yang's idea of UBI to mitigate these kinds of shocks makes more and more sense every day.",Reader Picks,NY

"Thank you, thank you, thank you for such a thoughtful piece. Since we really have no idea what the denominator is in terms of infections, keeping everybody quarantined is the only reasonable course for now. That way, the first wave of really ill people can hopefully be managed her the next couple of weeks. But keeping everybody locked down for an indefinite period of time seems like overkill. Businesses are already laying off massive numbers of people, which only increases hardships. We've heard the doomsday scenario, with some calling for a soft lockdown for everybody until we have a vaccine. Most experts think this will take at least another 15 months or so, and even with a vaccine, creating tens of millions of doses will take time. But what if a vaccine isn't found? Would we then live in a limited contact environment for 2 years? 3 years?? 5 years??? We will eventually need to have herd immunity, and one way or another we will get it. But it doesn't seem reasonable that every scenario needs to lead to economic ruin that will bankrupt big companies and small ones alike, and wipe out a large chunk of the entrepreneurial class. Retirement plans will be destroyed and local governments will go broke. We need to move towards a strategy of risk mitigation instead of risk elimination. Because risk elimination strategies never work completely; there are always ancillary effects.",Reader Picks,NY
"I am deeply troubled by this piece. It has so many weaknesses! One, there is way too much uncertainty about who will get seriously ill or die to even begin a serious attempt to develop criteria to identify the most vulnerable. Two, the unconscionable lack of testing and medical supplies to address the imminent tsunami of hospitalizations is the strongest argument for a full shutdown to flatten the curve. Three, this column does not offer even one specific suggestion re how we would ?do our utmost? to protect the most vulnerable. How would they be identified? How would the family members they live with be dealt with? The level of intervention needed to successfully carry out such a scheme boggles the mind. Or will we create ghettos? At worst, this is just a flimsy argument to provide moral cover to those who would let the virus run its course and let the vulnerable and the health care professionals who care for them die. At best, this ?cure? is even more unworkable than the one we are trying now. The current cure at least offers a way for everyone to help one another ? we are all in this together. The most dangerous thing about Mr. Friedman?s line of thinking is that it will endanger the fragile solidarity that true heroes, like Dr. Fauci, Governor Cuomo and most epidemiologists have fought for this week. Speculate all you want, but please do nothing to weaken the current response, which is our only hope right now.",Reader Picks,NY

There is a middle way - a way to slow down the spread and impact of the virus on the most vulnerable while not slamming shut the ability of many of us to work and support ourselves in the meantime.

"No one wants a depression, but alas, it may be the only thing that awakens hard headed, spoiled, and self centered Americans to the need for a change of our inequitable system. Forty years of monied interest's political control, the crush of workers unions, a lack of compassion for all to have health care, the rise of the Republican right to the level of fascism, ignorance to the threat to our planet and existence, and the dumbing down of America has led us to the election of Donald Trump. Amazingly, even in the face of gross irresponsibility and demagoguery, his reelection is possible, if not probable. Trying to save or keep our current economy for the sake of expediency and convenience may be the alternative reality. The reality is that none of this will change without a shock to the system as happened with the Great Depression. Unfortunately, if our youth do not respond immediately to their power at the ballot box, a reset may be in order. Our economy was headed in that direction anyway.

I see these suggestions as a dangerous gamble offered by those in the elite who are more worried about their stock portfolios than about the public health. Why doesn?t Mr. Friedman and Dr. Katz just volunteer to join the herd and get immune? We don?t have to destroy our economy to save public health.

Most of my patients sick with symptoms that could very well be due to COVID 19 are told to go home to isolate themselves - without testing.

In Italy, the bodies pile up faster than they can be cremated. I've not seen an explanation for this yet. What if people with asthma or just allergies have a high risk? Such conditions are rare in developing countries but very widespread in Western countries, and it appears very plausible that these conditions that affect the respiratory tract, would increase the risk from Covid-19. Another point, while 80% of cases reportedly recover without any medical intervention, what about the 15% that require hospitalization but not intensive care? 15% is a large number. These people recover, but only after having severe symptoms. That could mean they suffer irreversible lung damage.

At this critical juncture, our country needs a unified, universal response, guided by the ongoing analysis and direction of real experts at the CDC and the NIH.

Much more COVID testing is needed, however, to make informed decisions. In a short time we will have many COVID survivors who are no longer positive.

An idea worth exploring. However, Katz's idea, like any other aspect of our response to the virus requires competent leadership, which we do not have at the top of our government. Trump is 100 percent guilty of an inadequate response to this crises, including his failure to act in a timely manner, continuing lies and insults and his refusal to employ the Defense Production Act. We are the wealthiest and most powerful nation headed by a dangerously deeply flawed man. I am at present only concerned with the fact that our medical care providers are desperately begging for supplies for protective clothing and medical equipment, and their pleas are falling on deaf ears in the White House, including a leader who lives in his own construct of reality along with his adoring sycophants praising his ineptness.

"Why the need to reinvent the wheel? China, Hong Kong, Singapore, S. Korea and Japan have given us an excellent example of isolate, test, track the carriers, which has vastly limited, and in some cases halted new cases. The critical element missing in American is testing: we have so few kits, we have no idea the true number of infected. Our Federal response has been woefully slow, and inadequate, to say the least, criminally negligent at worst. In short, isolate long enough to test throughly, and then release those who are negative back into the general population. You don't have to be a pandemic expert, of which we have painfully few, to see mass scale examples that are already working. To re-engage otherwise, risks collapse of an under-personed, and appointed health care system. In Italy 20% of all hospital workers are infected. If 1-4% die, it makes the situation far worse. That result we don't need. Proven methodologies, over 6 weeks, can see us through the panic. In the meantime, we can print all the money we need to replace incomes. The UK has guaranteed 80% of all Britain's incomes for 90 days. We should follow suit. $1K per person is simply inadequate.

"Usually I agree with most of what Thomas Friedman writes, and what John Ioannidis writes usually makes sense, but the argument here is flawed on a number of grounds. Absolutely we need to avoid herd mentality, and to be nimble and adaptable in our response, but we have also to think things through before changing course. We don't know the mortality rate because we don't know the denominator - the number of people infected. We do know that for people who have been identified as infected, the mortality rate is about 5%. The only way a mortality rate of 1% would arise is if the disease is five times more prevalent than we appreciate. The critical issue is not the rate, but the absolute number of cases. A mortality rate of 1% for a disease affecting half the American population would mean close to 2 million deaths, not to mention a much larger number of people needing hospitalization and ICU care. That vastly exceeds the capacity of any health care system. Moreover we do not know that 2 weeks is an adequate period of isolation; there are Chinese reports of the virus persisting as long as 5 weeks, and the risk of second and third waves is very high. The best hope is to limit spread, to keep the absolute numbers low, and within our capacity to respond. This may not be possible, but magical thinking based on unsupported speculation is dangerous.",Reader Picks,Canada
"Young people would fall sick in such numbers that the more severe cases among them would overwhelm the medical system. Triage would take over.

"Several critical flaws in this opinion: 1) 40 percent of hospitalizations are under 55. 2) The vertical approach will continue to result in overburdened hospital capacity. 3) The risk of death for under 55 is not trivial. People will not return to normal economic activity, even if the government pivots to the vertical approach. 4) Asymptomatic cases continue to spread disease.",Reader Picks,

"No the benchmark is caring for all generations, regardless of age. And the essential benchmark is how we care for those we call 'elderly', those who 'generate' all of us. To suggest that those older and busy living are engaging in selfishness is not healthy or good. When we were young we were taken care of, nurtured, trained, taught. When those who did this for us are older, we take care of them and ensure that they have lives with dignity and meaning. We don't even suggest that they ought to 'step aside' or 'get out of the way'. The only worthy measure for us is how we care for those vulnerable and in need, regardless of age. A society without true compassion and love, that values only perceived utility, is a society hardly worth living in, and is barely worthy of being honored as civilization.",Reader Picks,Colorado
"I have been arguing for pretty much what is proposed by Katz for the past few days. I am seventy-five, and have a mild version of COPD, so I am in the vulnerable group. I am also retired and unproductive economically, and enjoy spending time on my own, pursuing my interests. Being forced to stay home and talk to my friends on FaceTime is no hardship for me (though I dread the possibility of my computer breaking down and not being able to get it fixed). The point is that there are millions of people like me. We need to be protected but we are not needed for our economic productivity, which is zero. Some of us have been contributing childcare, and that would have to stop, but here the government can step in with grants to families to hire help, and some parents will have to reduce their working hours. The workforce is almost all under 70?leaving aside tenured professors and others who should have retired?and they should go back to work. Many will get sick and a small fraction of them will die, but many more lives will be saved and?this is a crucial point?tens of millions of lives will be spared ruin.",Reader Picks,Canada
"I fear that you and Dr. Katz are subjecting yourselves to your own form of happy group think. The economy of the world, which is more interconnceted than ever, simply cannot be put back together as it was. This global shut down is going to have world wide impacts, country wide impacts and local impacts. Humpty Dumpty has already fallen off the wall. I heard an interview today with the CEO of ATT who said the network was holding up very well and that was despite 80% of employees working from home. If the implication of what he was saying is that the age of telecommuting has finally arrived, that would be bad news for restaurants, retailers, car manufacturers and car suppliers, operators of mass transit, owners of office space, lenders to and investors in, all of the above. The airline and hotel industries will be in a downsizing mode for decades. This pandemic is going to have huge affects on humanity no matter how it is dealt with. It may even shift consumer spending v savings habits which could have either beneficial or negative affects. Let's learn something from Nassim Taleb (author of ""The Black Swan).

"If we follow Dr. Katz's advice and 'save' the economy by just socially isolating the vulnerable we would quarantine the 16% of the population over 65 and the medically compromised. Then we would let the coronavirus run its course over the remaining 220 million 'healthy' younger component of the population. There would likely be a relatively rapid spike in the number of infected that could easily reach 100 million. Even though these are younger, healthier individuals, data from China indicated that the young are not as resistant to serious disease as one initially speculated. Dr Katz's guess that the mortality rate is 'only 1%' suggests over a million 'healthy' people will die. What if the mortality rate is higher, especially when this spike in infections will overwhelm the healthcare system. I think I'll go with Dr. Fauci's advice.",Reader Picks,Indiana

But - still - those who are healthier and younger must follow strict guidelines, too. That is imperative. They are potentially placing all others at risk by: A. being possible carriers; and B. getting the coronavirus in such a mild form that they are almost asymptomatic, emphasis on ""almost."" What I am saying is that I agree with our governors who are sheltering their whole states in place. Now, the economy. Katz has the right idea. At some point, sooner rather than later our small businesses must be reopened. Just averaging what other epidemiologists are recommending, however, I think three weeks rather than two is safer.

"As if on cue, Bret Stephens, Lloyd Blankfein, and Tom Friedman are more concerned about capitalism than anything else. In a series of hemming and hawing posts and articles, each of them quotes the article by John Ioannidis saying basically wait let's not go too far here until we have better data, which was predictably like catnip to conservatives like these three. Many have now pointed out the absurdity of Ioannidis's thesis, which is that since we don't have all the data we might possibly have months from now, we should hold off on taking the drastic measures that we're taking to combat or even slow down this pandemic. No, we don't have all the data we will have but everyone with actual expertise in the medical and epidemiological data that we do have, very much not including Ioannidis who has none, say that if anything we're not being drastic enough. To be quite honest, this reaction from people like Stephens and Friedman, more concerned about the health of the patient known as unfettered capitalism than actual patients, has convinced me once and for all that it's our entire system that needs to be reworked. Forget half measures, forget trying to ""expand"" Obamacare, fighting Republicans the whole way who will defeat any expansion.

Imagine a patient with chest pain, or a developing stroke, where speed is essential to save lives, hesitating to call 911 for fear of catching the coronavirus."" Hello! That would have nothing to do with non-essential businesses being closed -- that fear would be of the coronavirus itself. And that fear will be worse, not better, if hospitals become overwhelmed. ""Or a cancer patient having to delay chemotherapy because the facility is closed."" Why would such a facility be closed?? And again, if it were closed because of medical doctors handling the coronavirus, then that situation will be worse, not better, if hospitals become overwhelmed. ""Or a patient with advanced emphysema who dies for lack of a facility with a ventilator"".

Additionally, we don?t have enough ventilators to treat all the people who are already infected and will show symptoms in the next week. We need even more of a lockdown than we already have. If we took the approach of Korea, testing all contacts of an infected person and texting all residents of a given area that someone around them is infected (including which places they visited) then we could largely return to normalcy.

"Mr. Friedman is a great thinker. I applaud him for starting this important discussion. But he is overly optimistic about a targeted isolation approach and he grossly underestimates the virulence of the SARS CoV2 virus. Several other readers have addressed the epidemiological problems with his proposal. I will just add that death is a lagging indicator in COVID-19. South Korea?s mortality rate is now >1% as deaths catch up to diagnoses. Let?s move on to the virus itself. I am an emergency physician and have cared for thousands of patients, including hundreds with respiratory infections. Viral pneumonias, including those due to influenza, rarely cause illness severe enough to require hospitalization for anyone but very young children, the very elderly, or the chronically ill. SARS CoV2 is different. It can cause healthy young and middle-aged people to become dangerously sick. It aggressively invades the lungs, sometimes seriously damaging them. The majority of Americans hospitalized with this virus are under age 65, as are half of patients admitted to ICUs - i.e. on ventilators! That is extremely alarming. Yes, the elderly are the ones dying, but the young who get severely ill will take months to recover and we don?t yet know the long-term effects of CoV2 lung injury. So no, you cannot just go to work, get the virus, and make your contribution to herd immunity. Our ICUs would burst at the seams and many young people might be left with permanently impaired lung function.",Reader Picks,CA
"The analysis presented by Thomas Friedman on behalf of a Yale scholar ignores the brutal fact that Covid19 patients fall into three camps, not two as assumed in the analysis. Based on fairly large scale experience across countries now, some 10-15% of newly infected patients will need supplemental oxygen, some high flow oxygen or a ventilator in a hospital. Though most all of these patients could survive with appropriate care. At the moment, some 1-3% in addition are destined to succumb to the infection despite good care. No thoughtful person proposes letting 10-15% of the infected population who could be saved with medical care die. If for no other reason than the math: if 50% of Americans get infected (likely will be higher) then 15-20% of those infected will need medical care and many more than 3% will die without it. 15% of 150 million Americans, or ~22 million Americans could die or undergo prolonged suffering........does Thomas Friedman or anyone else think that is an ok price to pay to maintain our economy ?",Reader Picks,CA
"I work in a Whole Foods and I believe every grocery and drug store worker needs to be tested. Now. Many workers are working (as usual) through a cold or a cough for the extra money at a time when even a cold is potentially dangerous, having no idea if this is a regular cold or COVID-19. Some cough responsibly into their elbows, some cough into a gloved hand. Sanitation efforts are poor. Grocery stores are petri dishes. Shop carefully. Wear gloves, don't touch your face. Throw your reusable bag in the washing machine. Those employees testing positive should shelter in place and be given financial security for as long as it takes for them to get better -- or they will continue to work, even if they know they are sick. Once an employees is testing disease free, she's immune can do her job with little to fear. Everyone entering a grocery store needs to be told how to behave since, apparently, shoppers are oblivious-- stop licking your hand to open plastic bags and then touch an apple, be respectful of the workers' space, and if you're wearing a mask, stop adjusting it with your hands in front of your mouth before grabbing produce. Grocery stores are handing out gloves to employees, but without instruction and reminders, it's pointless to wear gloves if your going to rub your nose and scratch your face. In Italy, when you shop, you have to stand six feet away from the person in front of you when you enter the store. It's annoying, time consuming, and life saving.",Reader Picks,

Researchers in Japan have already reported there are at least two strains, meaning that the virus has mutated (nucleotide replication errors are to be expected). The world is ramping up to minimize the potential impacts of so many hospitalized patients, and in the U.S. it appears that more than half are under 50 years old.

I also wish Mr. Friedman would stop trying to return us to some imaginary center that complies with neo liberal economic theory.,Reader Picks,CA
"I live in Spain. As of 10:10 GMT March 23, 2020 the number of confirmed Coronavirus cases in Spain is 29,909 and the number of deaths is 1,813. That?s 6 percent! I read that in Italy the numbers are 59,138 confirmed cases and 5,476 deaths, over 9 percent! We?re in Spain?s government imposed Lockdown, not simply a polite request to self-isolate or to reduce social interaction. It?s a national quarantine. The streets where I live are mostly empty. We are permitted to make necessary trips to get groceries, medicine, or medical care, with only a few other reasons. Taking our dog out on short walks is permitted. My perception is that the Lockdown here is respected by the people as necessary to limit the Pandemic?s rapid spread of disease and death. I fully support the Lockdown. My wife is at high-risk, and I guess my age puts me in that category as well. I think the situation in my home country in the US will get much worse before a vaccine is developed. In the meantime, a quarantine there would slow the spread of disease and death. Life is precious, and more critical than the damage to the economy, which can be rebuilt.",Reader Picks,Spain

"Community physician (i.e. not an academic) here. Dr. Katz, and hence Friedman, have glossed over some important points. Protect the most vulnerable, they say. How will that be possible in the midst and an uncontrolled epidemic? Will there be a single nursing home that's avoids having an infected caregiver come to work? Not in the let everybody just get infected and be done with it scenario they propose. And how can the old or sick get groceries or medications? Have them delivered by the young and sick? We know that while mortality is low in those under 50 or 60 a significant number will require hospital care. If even 1% of a hundred million cases require admission, much less ICU care, the system will overwhelmed. What happens then to those vulnerable people who have a heart attack or need emergency surgery? Friedman, who is normally sober and well informed has fallen under the sway of academics too far removed from the reality of American life and healthcare to be of much use.",Reader Picks,Michigan
"Thank you Mr Friedman for the article. With due respect, everybody does appreciate a need to broaden the discussion, but we should not arbitrarily broaden it. (1) We do not have comprehensive testing (2) The virus spreads asymptomatically (3) We cannot identify and sequester the vulnerable (4) 20% of identified cases seem to require hospitalization (5) We must not gamble with an assumed 1% fatality rate. And it IS assumed at this time. We've seen anything ranging from 0.6% to 5% or even higher, with WHO estimating 3.4% the last time I checked. In the face of unprecented economic calamity and unthinkable hardship, as you rightly point out, we absolutely DO need sober balance. We need alternatives. But please do not put forward a logically inconsistent and unworkable appeal to restart the ecomony -- at the cost of many millions of American's lives and subsequent collapse of healthcare infrastructure -- that is NOT balance. It's madness. It is incumbant on the 'thoughtful backlash' to provide a credible proposal that isn't at odds with the advice of our best medical professionals, epidemiologists and disaster response specialists -- and indeed the consensus of the rest of the world so far. Can we instead study what certain other countries seem to be doing so well (SK, Japan, Norway)?

We need Universal Health Care and a massive immediate push to build bigger and better hospitals and have a National ventilator and medical supply permanent storage facility.

"Moving along with the suggestion from Dr. Katz, a research group at Mt Sinai in NYC has published a preliminary report on convalescent serum testing for coronavirus infection. This is necessary: We need to know who has had asymptomatic infection and is now virus free. These people can circulate freely and do their jobs, because they have virtually no known risk to infect others given their immunity, and they seem likely to have low risk of recurrent infection. I am not seeing any discussion of development of such a convalescent serum test, but it is a very standard item in medicine. It should become a priority along with primary coronavirus testing. We know that approximately 80% of coronavirus infections are minimally or asymptomatic, so identifying those who are through the crisis will be helpful to get people back on the job. For those who are demonstrated to be immune, we need some form of ID so they can demonstrate to others that contact with them is safe. This is particularly important for healthcare workers, so we can know who can go back to work after quarantine or infection. We also need to identify these people as potential blood donors. Studies are pending on the concept of the use of hyperimmune serum to bolster immunity in seriously ill people with COVID. Knowing who has an immune response may prove lifesaving through serum donation, until we can have commercial production of cell-culture-produced antibodies.",Reader Picks,MA

"I really appreciate this column and in principle I buy it 100%. But there are three major wrinkles: First, for this to work there has to be access to widespread testing with rapid results?preferably available over the counter?so that people can rapidly self quarantine.

As long as the whole population is being squeezed by this, there?s motivation to protect everyone because we all sink or swim together.

A depression that will make the 1930's look like a Sunday afternoon tea party will be in the offing. It is patently amoral to destroy the lives of an entire population to lessen mortality for 15% who are overwhelming very old with other contributing severe maladies. The fairer approach is a total lockdown for 2 weeks, then turn the American economy back on fully.

Widespread testing for the antibodies to the coronavirus will reveal that there are many people who had it, who overcame it without knowing they were infected (and thus now test negative for the virus itself), and who are not going to get it again.

"""Expansive thinking""? The problem is rather that it is narrow thinking.

And in doing so, it overlooks or does a poor job weighing the costs to others, except as they align with the interests of those espousing such solutions. That sort of vulnerability to class myopia pertains to Dr. Katz at Yale as much as Mr. Friedman at the New York Times. True, the poor and less affluent are disproportionately harmed by an economic downturn, by being out of work, but it is rather cavalier to be trading off their health versus economic risks as if a new day were about to dawn ""in weeks"" if only we all saw the light, when they'd be taking the brunt of the health risks as well. It's a bit much when the interests of the affluent so clearly align with putting workers back to work asap and stopping the stock market bleed, even with a high mortality rate among those least prepared to face and weather a medical crisis.

I?m in favor of a national lockdown for non-essential workers, but even then there?d be a ton of essential workers going about spreading the virus. There?s no way that in a two week timeframe we?ll have enough testing to cover all these non-isolating essential workers. There?s no way to tell definitively who will become gravely ill with lung damage or even die. It?s not just a problem for the old. In the U.S. 40% of those hospitalized are between 20 and 54. Any real epidemiologist- not just a nutrition writer for Oprah magazine - will tell you the ?let the working age population get sick? strategy will quickly overrun the capacity of our hospital system many times over. A surgical strategy is only possible when the situation is under control, i.e. testing is widespread, community spread is not growing exponentially.

Valuing the economy over the lives of older Americans is a treacherous slope to a less ethical society. Already, we know and. too readily accept that the poor get mediocre health care, if they get healthcare. I'm not sure the economy could change. It would take courageous leadership. I remember that Bernie Sanders was invited to give a speech at the Vatican on ""The Moral Economy"", a concept he has not talked much about lately. To the Establishment, the idea of a moral economy is unAmerican. The pandemic could be a turning point. For the future of America, the World and our small planet, I hope for a more moral economy.

With a rate of doubling of 3 days, we achieve ""herd immunity"" in less than 40 days from today without social separation--and in addition to the 2 to 7 million deaths, there would be 10 to 20 percent (20 to 40 million) still needing medical attention--with no medical care to help them. Plan on nearly 50 million of us dying if we drop social separation, assuming it causes no social upheaval.

At a rate of 200 million infected, that would be 2-4 million on the high end, not 50 million. But let's take a step back for a second: nobody is saying to let it run its course -- Friedman and Katz are advocating to isolate and shelter in place the most vulnerable people (old and people with medical conditions making them especially vulnerable). If we do that efficiently, we're looking at a death toll well below one million. We will likely reach the same death toll anyway in the next 12-18 months of flattening the curve.

People that have been quarantined for 14 days can be tested and go back to work without risk of infecting others. People still working like our brave health care professionals can be tested and be assured that they won't infect other people. Without testing, we are fighting blind: If you can't find the enemy, you can't defeat it. And after over 2 months of seeing this train coming toward us, why aren't there more tests?",Reader Picks,CA
"You do not understand the issue you are facing. This is EXACTLY what Europe is trying to achieve: contain a virus, protect the weak, and get a herd immunity.

First we contain initial wave and then we go back to normal life just everyone keep physical distance, using face masks and washing hands frequently. Trying to achieve herd immunity in weeks will result in genocide. I really hope that human life is valued more in the USA. While growing up we were always told to look up to the USA as you were always ahead of everyone in technology and science. Why are Americans trying to avoid being leaders now? What happened?

"This is a deeply irresponsible column. If you read into the epidemiology discussions that are underway, you realize that the folks that Friedman has highlighted are far outside the consensus view of others in the field. Credible modeling of the approach that Friedman puts forth, by a group at Imperial College, indicates that the consequence would be 2.2 million deaths in the US between now and the end of July, peaking at 51,000 deaths a day in mid-June.

"This is why pushing the federal government to expand testing as broadly and quickly as possible is so important."" No, Thomas, not ""important""...absolutely CRITICAL! But that's the problem you see, we have a President, supported by Republicans, who did not take any of this seriously, and still don't. Because if they did, and do, we would see a massive effort put to securing, creating, and distributing tests so that we could actually identify the riskiest people and not have to resort to this highly ineffective, but absolutely necessary, general lock down. That Trump and his toadies have actually prevented this from happening is criminal. His is the very antithesis of what even an average leader would do, and as a result he and his Republican enablers are sowing more confusion, more fear, and more suffering and death - this is all on their hands. Given this complete lack of leadership, state and local governments, as well as other leaders in the private sector, ought to simply ignore the directions from Trump and do what they think is best. If he has a problem with that, they can tell him to ""Sue me! Take me to court"", just like he's done his whole life.

Yet somehow society didn't collapse and Europe didn't devolve into the Stone Age. They just rebuilt. It is not apparent that shutting down bars, restaurants and other economic activity even for many months is going to mean the end of civilization as opposed to say a deep recession followed by a rapid recovery.

"Mr. Friedman, with all due respect to you and to Dr. Katz, MUCH OF WHAT HE RECENTLY WROTE was already out of date. Likewise, he FAILED TO COMMUNICATE one (1) of the key Lessons Learned from the Spanish Flu pandemic of 100 years ago. The comparison is Philadelphia's response vs. St. Louis' response. The City Fathers in Philadelphia WAITED ONE (1) WEEK to lock down the City, whereas the City Fathers in St. Louis did so almost immediately. Approximately 12,000 people perished in Philadelphia and, thankfully, just a small fraction of that total in St. Louis. Here in Ohio, the St. Louis model was applied early on by Gov. DeWine. It appears that Ohio is the process of ""weathering this storm."" And I hasten to add, what many of Mr. DeWine's peers (e.g., Cuomo, Murphy, Pritzker, Newsom, et al.) are doing is based on what appears to be working here. In ca. three (3) weeks, we have seen the battleship turned around and many good things are now happening that will save lives. Having done investigations over the past forty (40) years, I am always reminded that if we knew all of the answers at the start, we'd have gotten done sooner. The reality is that mistakes will always be made, mistakes will be corrected, and the Lessons Learned will enable us to better handle the next like crisis.",Reader Picks,Ohio

"This is a complex problem with a complex set of circumstances that is extremely difficult to navigate. In order for the writer?s idea to work, a large testing of the entire population would have to take place , then separating those infected from those who are not infected . We do not have enough of those required tests . As a nation, there should have been a complete system already in place to fight a worldwide pandemic . This should include having billions of protective gear federally stockpiled for health workers , an organized and well thought out plan for massive testing and areas identified in each state where mobile hospitals can be built . But now since there was no real plan in place , we are flying by the seat of our pants and headed towards both an economic and public health catastrophe. If Trump had not disbanded the pandemic task force , I feel they would have started preparations in December as soon as they heard of what was happening .

The black death being visited by this virus on Italy, and which I fear is headed our way, should be the message to all of us that the way we organize our globalized economy and our civilization is fatally flawed.

It should be the last straw that tells us it's time to decouple ourselves from an authoritarian Chinese regime that wishes to play by a different set of rules than the rest of us. It should say to us that it is long past time to retire the principle of ""privatize the profits and socialize the costs."" And what is Tom Friedman's response to this crisis? It is to let our economy go back to business as usual, as if there were no lessons to learn, and effectively let the weaker and less fortunate among us get out the way, no matter by how many multitudes we may be compounding their risk, and look at their horrible deaths as their taking one for the team or thinning the herd. Tom Friedman's response apparently is to double down on ""privatize the profits and socialize the costs.""

Our economy can't go back to normal until we've tested the heck out of this virus the way Iceland and South Korea have, and then locked down our borders to nations that haven't. Getting to this state of affairs is going to take months longer than it should have, and the fault for that lies largely with the Trump administration and in particular its failure to ramp up the testing, including rejecting the German test that was successfully being used elsewhere. But what if we didn't have to wait until it was safe to go back to normal? What if there was a shortcut that required us to put millions at many times greater risk but offered the plausible deniability that it was their fault for not isolating themselves better? Then all this wouldn't have to be Trump's fault. It could be the nanny-state liberals and the know-it-alls coastal elitists who were holding back our economy and our lives from getting back to normal.

"With the best of intentions, Tom Friedman gets it wrong, again. The best solution is to ""flatten the curve"" to prevent overwhelming medical resources -- which has been show to increase mortality (see Italy; see China). The idea of providing ""herd immunity"" for the population by exposing the vast majority of them to a potentially fatal disease is simple insanity based on the idea that money is more important than people.

Along the lines of ?you go to war with the army you?ve got?, we need to face this epidemic without adequate testing, personal protective equipment, hospital capacity or ventilators. And that?s why we shut down a huge part of the economy. Our winner take all economy left too many vulnerable and now we?re all going to find out what that means. I hope we learn the right lessons. The people do not exist to service the economy. The economy exists to provide for the people.",Reader Picks,MA
"I am an old guy--but in Italy, most over 90 (far older than I am) do fine. Many relative youngsters, with risk factors or not get exceedingly sick also. (I read a tale of two hospital workers recently in the Wuhan area, both young women, both healthy who caught coronavirus. One died of Coronavirus, the other did not.) People with pre-existing conditions--especially lung damage, are very much at risk. Smokers may be a bigger risk factor than age. The Chinese quarantine worked! They are getting about 44 new cases a day--and it is holding constant. The South Koreans have also stabilized with far less coercive tactics, but are seeing a pretty steady new caseload, well within their medical establishment's ability to care for. As their caseloads stabilize and their ability to handle patients increases, both can further reduce restrictions. No restrictions means in 40 days, you have about 15 million sick people (minus a couple of million of the aged). How well will the 10% who need medical attention be treated when they arrive at hospitals all n the same week? (as they will) BTW, the science behind the COVID-19 virus and the first tests were all developed by the Chinese who immediately released it to the world. Had our government used that information (or just used the test developed by the Germans and given to the WHO), our testing would be 80 days ahead of where we are now.",Reader Picks,CA
"All true--but about 1%--3% of you would be dead from the virus, and another 5% or so would be dead because the millions who would all get sick the same week would swamp the system in about 40 days. Using social distancing for long enough to knock down the exponential growth should take a few weeks (3 or 4)(as it did in China and S. Korea). Then, with milder social distancing, keep the rate at a manageable level for the hospitals and medical teams until we get a vaccine or effective drug therapy. A few weeks of inconvenience could easily save a few million lives. What do you think of the trade-off.",Reader Picks,CA
"To those thinking a ""few"" deaths to the old is immaterial: Every 5 days the population of infected people doubles with a death rate of about 0.9%. With some 400 dead the US is somewhere between the 9th and 10th doubling. This means the virus has been around for about a month and a half coinciding with about the beginning of February. On the 11th doubling, about 8 or 9 days hence, you are looking at around 2,000 deaths. On the 17th doubling, some one and a bit months out, the number of deaths is around 350,000. The under 60 death rate is around 20% so you've got around 70,000 deaths of people under 60 one a bit months out. So the real issue with this contagion is that although the rates of death are small, the large population coupled with fast transmission means the number of deaths is large. In addition the need for ICU beds, respirators, and hospitalization could not cope. Is that your idea of a ""few""?",Reader Picks,CA
"This piece is interesting. I believe that saving the economy also saves lifes. But there is flaw in the general argument that shows near the end of the text: ""we shut down for months to try to save everyone everywhere from this virus ? no matter their risk profile ? and kill many people by other means, kill our economy and maybe kill our future."". Shutting down for weeks or months is NOT intended to ""save everyone, everywhere"". That would be unrealistic and naive. It is implicitly admmited in that approach that almost everyone will get the virus. It aims to avoid that too many people get it AT THE SAME TIME. Because if they do, the small percentage that would need treatment would nevertheless be too much for the health system to cope. And therefore lots of people would unneccessarily fue. As tempting as the ""two weeks isolation only"" sounds and even if it's undelying principle is correct, the logistics and challenges behind implementing any such approach are immense. It would demand high quality information being properly and quickly processed. We don't have either of those right now. Acquiring that information takes time. Unfortunately it also takes that more cases happen. However, if most of us do isolate right now and in honest, then we will have bought the time needed to ponder about the solutions to be adopted afterwards. So please, stay home untill it is safe for you to go out again. That will be decided in due time for those who are experts on the matter.",Reader Picks,Brazil
"Of course, Americans will rail against the socialist principles needed to take care of their weakest, physically and economically speaking, even in terrifying times likes these. But for goodness sake try to, even for a little while.

If a safety net like that could be put in place temporarily (I know, I can hear all those go-getting, Just-Do-It, everyman-for-himself Americans shouting me down) because these are extraordinary times, not because people are lazy and want to be paid to be stuck at home.

"I am a pulmonary and critical care physician in Minneapolis. The problem with the approach mentioned is that, inevitably, there are overlapped rates of people becoming carriers as they are exposed to family, friends, or coworkers in the ""vertical"" approach. As that occurs, they will inevitably spread it to those who are vulnerable, who cannot remain completely isolated (they need caregivers, health provider, people to deliver them food, etc). Under the vertical approach, spread will more likely occur to the entire population. And yes, that would allow for economic activity to continue, but would also lead to nearly everyone being exposed. That would eventually cause ""herd immunity"" prior to a vaccine being developed. Do you realized what that ""herd immunity"" means? It means that everyone is exposed and recovers...and 3 million people (1% of the population) die. Herd immunity works when you have a harmless vaccine...but you do not want herd immunity through exposing everyone to an active virus with 1% mortality and 20% severe illness! Likely more than 1% would die because the healthcare system would be overwhelmed and collapse. Until we have an effective vaccine, allowing everyone except ""the vulnerable"" to be exposed is a terrible idea.",Reader Picks,Minneapolis

"Although I certainly don't begrudge the Times their publishing of the ""contrarian view"", I'd really like to see them publish a rebuttal of this view from one of the vast majority of public health experts who emphatically do not share it. The vertical model proponents tend to criticize emotion driven thinking, but they are no less guilty of it; only they peddle false hope in the place of fear. Secondly, the contrarians need to be crystal clear about what it is they are really proposing, which is to let this thing just wash over the population at large with the exception of high risk groups. Leaving aside the logistical feasibility of pulling this off, NYC is reporting a significant rate of infection among people under 50, including severe cases requiring hospitalization. Finally, though this may be glibly dismissed as ""groupthink"" why do you suppose the government of no developed country, advised by their best and brightest, is proposing a vertical model? Such talk was very au courant in the UK until just last week-- when a visibly chastened Boris Johnson abruptly changed his tune. Why do you suppose that might be?

"Our response is reminiscent of how we fought the war in Vietnam. It is not wise, nor is it leadership, to elevate a single measure of success to the neglect of all other factors.

Thus far, our response to the CV reminds me of our approach to the war in Vietnam. We have zeroed in on a single aspect of the problem, (direct deaths from CV), and implemented a means of gauging success (body count), that fails to consider a variety of of critical social, economic and political factors (all of which may leave their own medical issues in their wake). Does ""fewer CV deaths"" automatically equal victory, or are there other elements of the problem to account for? An overly facile measure of success in the VN war produced failure at the strategic level. We won the tactical body count contest every time, but the overall strategy was a failure.

I'm glad to hear you where fortunate to have a mild case of coronavirus. However I think the media has been very clear that the majority of people- around 80% - will have mild symptoms. The 'fear mongering' as you call it is based on epidemiological models that show that more than a million Americans could die this year from coronavirus without strong action. The fact that some experience very mild or no symptoms at all is exactly the problem with this virus: These so called asymptomatic cases are one of the main reasons it is spreading so quickly. It's not just the old. In the U.S. 40% of those hospitalized are between 20 and 54. I assume you are in self-quarantine to protect the health of others in your community.

We can hope for a quick return to normal, but that is impossible. Human behavior will be changed.

And alarmingly, we are seeing numerous people, relatively young and with limited or no underlying illnesses, requiring ventilators and even dying in the space of days. There is a reason our government is taking drastic measures. If we can get the majority of working people working from home, great. That's a big if.

"Tom Friedman, the man of a million inanities comes through with another set. The time for controlling this through a targeted approach has passed long ago. Shutting down the country for 2 weeks is worthless since it takes 2 weeks to even begin to see if it works.

Without a complete shutdown, any state shutdown will not work. I would say that I have not read such a senseless column until I saw Slaughter's column today, which even makes Friedman's column look deep. Sometimes you need a powerful state that comes in and says: Here is what is going to be done, we are going to enforce it, and we are going to cover the fallout in a very direct and efficient way. Of course, given that we have a 4 year old in charge of the country, that will not happen.

"Coronavirus and the American economy? The American economy has always been a massive contradiction and the coronavirus just seals the proof on the discrepancies. We have been told for decades the U.S. has the greatest economy, that the U.S. is the land of innovation, that all the technological developments, machines replacing people at work, etc. leads to a better life, but it was always strange how millions have always been driven unusually hard at work, that all this economic performance and supposed increased efficiency has never led to increase in leisure and freedom for most people but only wealth and leisure at the top of society, and now with the coronavirus we are told that the almighty U.S. economy might collapse within weeks, as if for all that power of economy, and all that hard work, there was nothing there all along saved up to bail out millions of people on a rainy day, which makes us ask of course where all the U.S. wealth has gone or if it wasn't a big lie in the first place the U.S. economy was improving all this time. So which is it? Millions of people have watched for decades old America wiped out, small town life and jobs gone, the big cities and corporations rise, all that innovation and advancement occur.

If we end two weeks of pseudo-isolation, it will only take a few asymptomatic cases to start the spread of the virus again. Germany has now seen three days in a row of declining numbers of new cases.

Can the country handle that? What if the mortality is 3.5%, as some have estimated - or 13 million people. That's more than the population of all but the four most populous states. So you'd be ok if the equivalent of six Nebraskas being emptied of people? Second, morbidity: long-term debilitating effects for those who are infected and suffer some complications (immediate or delayed). This can include lung scarring and permanently decreased physical health. The morbidity effects will be more widespread and worsened if people don't receive treatment (i.e., if we don't ""flatten the curve""). No one knows what is going to happen.

(TV is a nice addition) So, I propose we shut down what I call the ""money for space"" market. For the next 90 days at least, no one is required to pay- Rent Mortgage Utilities Virus care Temporary, to all these necessities are are not paid. Except food which many can cover with Social Security, savings, government handouts. The renter and the landlord thus have no need for their usual income. Same for the homeowner. Same for workers and business owners. The person who owns a restaurant can close it for now. He will not lose the space. His landlord also pays no mortgage on the space. The employees will not pay their rent or mortgage. When the crisis ends, it's back to work, fire up the grill and let's eat out! (emergency property maintenance will need funding but many will volunteer that labor) With these things covered, there is little need for income. Everyone can take a 90 day break.

We don?t know how many additionally will die from inability to get basic medical treatment for cancer and other things people have today. We don?t know how many people will have pulmonary fibrosis left over from Covid, which is a serious condition. We do know that a lot of younger people will become infected, too. If this seems wrong, look at Italy and imagine what would have happened had the brakes been let off.

It depends on people being both self-aware and self-disciplined about their medical conditions, future possibility of infection, and impact on others -- can this lead to serial spikes? The empirical evidence is not comforting for masses of people to willingly adopt more nuanced interdiction methods without effective government.

"Thomas, it seems to me this technocratic thinking neglects a few very big things. First, too little is known about the effects of the virus in the younger population; that large groups are not at risk is largely conjecture based on an incomplete data set. It is an incredible gamble, to say the least, to hope for ""uneventful"" herd immunity. It is also becoming clear there is a very significant number of cases with serious long term impairments like reduced lung capacity. Who gets to decide who should be infected, based on which data? Second, as any virus this thing just loves to mutate. We do not know how secure or lasting any herd immunity would be. The best way to arrive at lots of different strains is to give the virus lots of space to breed and mutate, possibly ending up with a problem multiplied.

There is only one thing I hope to be able to add, and that is on the subject of testing. It seems that the primary benefit of testing at this point is to get a grasp on where and how big the infected but asymptomatic population is. What I know of statistics tells me that requires random sampling of the population at large. It can't be accomplished by ""testing on-demand"" because a self-selecting sample will inevitably be badly biased. The takeaway is that as a matter of public health policy, testing should be conducted as directed by experts: physicians for individual patients, and epidemiologists for communities.

Multiply the relative infection rate (vs. flu) by the relative hospitalization rate, and you have at least 4 times the number of hospitalizations vs. flu, which will overwhelm our medical system.

When the reactors didn't prove profitable, the reactors were dismantled--and the brown-outs didn't happen. Mr. Friedman will have to forgive me for being skeptical of any claim that sounds like a billionaire's fondest dream. By the way, where are America's old people supposed to be sequestered? In internment camps, perhaps? So that they can all be together to make each other's infections worse?

Similarly other sectors of the economy would appear to be damaged long beyond a few weeks, let alone a few months. So 20% contraction seems possible - a severe blow to many. The first three stages of grief are 1) denial, 2) anger, and 3) bargaining. While Trump vacillates between 2 and 3 now, after spending a few months mired in 1), his base is most likely still mostly in 2) because that?s where they like to reside, in good times as well as bad. Friedman?s approach is more a 3) since it might involve bargaining away lives in order to prop up the economy. At some point, the terror of accepting that things have been fumbled badly by Trump and his enablers due to stubbornness will lead to the enduring of the pain of the loss of thousands of lives, whether statistically significant or not. The acceptance and grieving phases will be difficult for mature Americans, more so than those for whom compassion is to be avoided, or denied. To be stuck in 1) or 2) is to live without liberty.

We in the USA could have taken the Taiwan approach of large-scale testing of people for the virus and contact tracing, but the prevarication and delays of Trump and his GOP sycophants prevented that less deadly approach. At this stage, we still would need the large-scale testing --which Trump has refused to support and lend federal resources to -- and contact tracing.

Retail workers are complaining about lack of hand sanitizer and masks and many are choosing to report to work even if they are sick. ?Wages at Target start at $13 an hour, and employees often have a hard time getting more than 20 hours of work each week. Many are not offered health insurance through the company. All of which leaves employees facing a hard decision: If they feel a cold coming on, or if they were in contact with someone who was confirmed to have the coronavirus, many say they have no choice but to keep working.? The response by companies like Amazon is to hire 100,000 employees to account for workers who are too sick to come to work. ? Not all of the hiring is being done to simply meet demand. Employers are also bracing for when their workers get sick with the virus or are simply no longer able to get to work, and are planning accordingly. ?Some of our hiring is to manage risk, too,? Mr. Vanderelzen of Lineage Logistics said. ?We expect that some people will be quarantined or have to leave because of the virus.?",Reader Picks,NY

So thankful that you are, far more eloquently than I could, advocating this, or at least seriously considering this approach, through your much larger megaphone. Continuing the current world-wide suppression approach is going to lead, I believe, to untold economic disaster and may wind up saving no lives at all.

How exactly is 1/5 of the population of the US supposed to survive for the 2-3 months when Covid-19 is active world-wide? The death rate among the 68 million people most vulnerable will probably be something like 5% or more, which means 3 million or more deaths in the US over the June - August period.

If the doubling of transmissions is weekly then by week 30 you have around 10 million deaths, 9 million over 70 and 1 million under 70. The nastiness really starts getting huge by week 26 (one half a year). Play around with these numbers a bit and assume a transmission rate that doubles every two weeks.

Strange, Germany developed a test one week after China sent them the info. It took South Korea three weeks (end of January) to develop their own test, one test kit can test a 100 people.

"I think Mr. Friedman is still assuming that the COVID-vulnerable populations can be assessed with certainty in advance so they can be protected. This assumption is part of what got us into this disaster to begin with - the idea that young, otherwise healthy people have nothing to worry about - and now that it is spreading uncontrollably, we are finding that many young, otherwise healthy people are winding up on ventilators and dead. I am not sure it is in everyone's best interests to walk into a 1 in 20 chance of death to ""save the economy."" Furthermore, it is hardly likely that with pandemic-level spread, the people who most need protecting will be at all safe despite best efforts.",Reader Picks,NY
"The fundamental rationale for what Friedman labels the ""horizontal interdiction"" strategy is to ""flatten the curve"" of the inevitable upward slope of those seriously ill with Covid-19 so it doesn't overwhelm currently available hospital facilities and concurrently endanger our precious and limited resource of medical first responders. What is crucial is to ASAP expand both the capacity of our hospital facilities (beds and ventilators) and to end the shortage of Personal Protection Equipment to safeguard our medical staffs. But Friedman is absolutely right that we need FOR THE SAKE OF AVOIDING A CALAMITOUS SECOND GREAT DEPRESSION to switch to a ""vertical interdiction"" strategy sooner rather than later. That is why it is so witless that Trump keeps stalling on invoking the Defense Production Act to ensure and expedite supplying what we're now crucially lacking.",Reader Picks,NJ
"You know how the media can help? By featuring people who have already recovered from coronavirus who can testify that it is not a big deal at all for the vast majority of people. People are so scared of this virus because of media fear mongering and when I got it over two weeks ago (from someone I work with who flew in from Italy) I thought I was going to die, I was terrified. But it was no big deal. It was similar to a flu, but milder, basically a mild walking pneumonia, not worth spending a day in bed for. People need to be calmed down and told the truth. The majority needs to be heard, meaning the vast majority who recover just fine from this virus. My friends are panicked and then I tell them (on the phone, obviously) what I went through (not much really - a very low fever, mild headache, chest pressure, very occasional coughing, but that I still had plenty of energy and stamina every day - and they become calm and reassured. The media needs to do this. Feature the voices of people who are the real face of this virus, the vast majority, who are just fine. Not just the tragic cases that are the tiny minority, like a car accident on a busy freeway. When people have a realistic perspective, the panic can start to ease and normalcy can start to return. The government and medical institutions can focus on protecting the weak and vulnerable in special facilities, but let the rest of us deal with a minor cold/flu situation and get on with our lives and businesses.",Reader Picks,CA

"When a tsunami is headed your way, you head for safety when the water goes out, not when the wave is about to roll over you. Data from China said roughly 2% of identified cases died, weighted towards the elderly and infirm. That's the group Tom Friedman wants to focus on saving from CV19 exposure. But remember, 15% of all cases needed basic hospitalization for things like supplemental oxygen by cannula or face mask, IV fluids, or observation. Another 5% needed ICU care which presumably included most of the 2% who died. That still means a tsunami of patients well beyond our capacity if we can't flatten the curve. There are dangerous shortages of PPE right now in SF and the greater Bay Area. There's another Times article today by Donald McNeil discussing options for going forward. After decades as a journalist in this area and after consultation with ten or so international experts, he favors a whole series of interventions much more akin to the program in South Korea. Among other things, it focuses relentlessly on case identification through testing, vigorous contact identification, and isolation of those who are infected or closely exposed. This limits much of the family spread responsible for about 80% of new cases. Once testing is widely and quickly available (by far our biggest failure so far), a relatively short period of lockdown can be followed by careful resumption of normal activities.

These are the same Repubs who only cared about deficits when a Dem was president. When a Repub is president, they focus on cutting taxes for wealthy and beefing up defense (which further aids wealthy owners of defense company stocks). Paul Ryan adhered to GOP hypocrisy in crying about spending and deficits when Obama was in the White House, and then proceeded to push through a huge tax cut for the wealthy after Trump entered the White House, cuts which further worsened the deficit, giving us less room to go further into deficits to help relieve the economic downturn.

I completely agree with the ideas advanced in your article. We should concentrate on keeping infections away from older people and persons with health issues. For the rest of us we accept infection and trade it for immunity, assuming that everybody infected with the virus acquires immunity for at least several years.

"Indefinite social isolation doesn't make sense to me. The virus has a maximum, as far as we know, 14 day incubation period, with 97% incubating in under 11 days.

"The ideas presented here will not work and are dangerous. How are going to keep the elderly in their homes but not have others interact with them? The elderly also need food, need care, they ineed interaction. And it's not as if the millenials and the kids are immune. They are more likely to recover if they develop serious complications such as pneumonia, but some of them will die too. And unlike with the flu, there is no vaccine yet --- so you can't say ""well, you were warned and you should have vaccinated your kids."" I think that, instead, we need to develop a way to test EVERYONE, frequently. Then, you institute a rule that anyone who tests positive must stay home for the incubation period, be it 14 days or a month or whatever it is. We may need to require employers to provide sick leave and subsidize that somehow. Once they no longer test positive, then they can mix with the rest of the population and go back to work. An experiment was done in one town in Italy where they tested everybody --- turned out 3 per cent of the population was infected --- and they just kept those people at home. That strategy dramatically reduced the infection rate. So that would be a way to get most people back to work, get some recovery of the economy going, while saving lives. Eventually, a year or 18 months from now, a vaccine will be available and that will help get things back to normal.",Reader Picks,Canada

What about the younger teacher who lives with his high risk parents, or needs to care for them? What about the school nurse who is a single parent?

My takeaway of the American economy in light of coronavirus is that America has done everything possible to destroy freedom, independence at the bottom of society to prevent people from pioneering, self-isolating, having own property as in days of old. The bottom of society and middle class even is a large, interlocked, regulated herd which is neither free market (you really don't have much freedom to think or act) nor successfully socialistic, but is rather strung along, forced into long work hours in a society which boasts of having the most efficient, powerful economic engine ever in existence. The most powerful economic engine? One which actually leads to incredible waste in some respects (tossed food) but in others, makes life difficult (expensive homes, little leisure), and certainly leads to incredible wealth at top of society where apparently the people are trusted with leisure unlike the masses driven to work hard every day. Essentially the middle and lower classes are not trusted with freedom, leisure, are to be grouped and controlled as much as possible, and if self isolation, freedom exists in America, it's at the top of society and depends on wealth.

"It is necessary to start thinking about what restarting looks like, but the timeframes discussed in this article ignore two troublesome aspects of Covid-19: the contagiousness of undiagnosed or symptom-free carriers, and the unknown but apparent persistence of the virus after symptoms. I have no credentials here, but if you take these two factors into consideration, you can plainly see that simply going with the nominal two-week hiatus is not only utterly lacking in any scientific basis, but will very likely result in the resumption of the exponential community transmission problem which is the hallmark of the pandemic. Now both of these issues could be addressed by a national testing program. If anyone with upper respiratory symptoms can readily get tested free-of-charge, it becomes possible to identify the population that needs to be isolated. Following on that, it also becomes possible to determine when infected individuals are no longer contagious, which among other things would establish some clinical parameters for what kind of quarantine is actually indicated.

So, in fact, it seems that many people in the business world are cold to the fact that we may NEED the facts before we start insisting we're all ""strong Americans"" who can just get back to work. And, yes, the thought that we can somehow send the 20 and 30-year-olds back to run the show is quite amusing.",Reader Picks,Florida
"There no full-proof, fail-safe tactics to simultaneously fix the virus and fix the economy: I personally feel that once the predator (virus) is fixed by some common pains and sacrifices (disappearing stocks, mass lay-offs, etc), within a month the economy can be brought back to where it was, let?s say beginning of February 2020. The problem is we are facing a deadly and extremely aggressive virus that is playing havoc on the immune systems of some of the those unlucky humans ( mostly but not exclusively elderly with background illnesses) to destroy one organ systems after another until nothing is left in the body. This is the pandemic of 2020 in its ugliest form. Hence bringing economy and the virus on the same equation won?t solve anything. Priority should now be to defeat the enemy as fast as possible by standard and time- tested epidemiological and medical means. It will cost the human society a lot in the shorter term: in the end the humanity would certainty stand victorious.",Reader Picks,Antarctica
"Isn't that exactly what Friedman says in the article. He's not even suggesting going any of this stuff until testing is universally available, and the hospitals are provided for. Those the the prerequisites for this idea.",Reader Picks,VA
"I've been thinking about the same idea. By isolating healthy, younger people, with a very small risk of death from the disease, we're preventing them from vaccinating themselves with the mild form of the disease and contributing to the herd immunity that will end the epidemic. The goal is to minimize the number of deaths and serious illnesses, not the number of infections. To that end we should concentrate research on how the virus causes fatal infections vs mild infection. With bubonic plague, the patient is infected by flea bites, and dies in around 10 days. There is another form called pnuemonic plague that is droplet spread, and causes death in 1 to 4 days. Perhaps when high doses of covid-19 are spread directly into the lower lungs from sneezing, coughing, very sick people, the disease is more severe. Therefore, we should be isolating sick people most of all, and not asymptomatic people with a positive test. Furthermore, vulnerable people should wear masks when they are around other people. All people around vulnerable people should also wear masks. I think children don't get severe disease as often because they don't wash their hands and spread the milder, nasal form of the disease, immunizing each other. Preventing mild disease by excess cleanliness may make things worse.",Reader Picks,OR

There is a reason governments all over the world are taking action.

"China's starategy of lock-downs and quarantining, seem to have worked, at least for now. South Korea?s massive testing and treatment seem to have worked as well, again, for now. We didn't do the former, i.e., China model, because we are not China. We could have done the latter model, i.e., South Korea, but Trump wass in denial at first before saying/lying that he knew all along that it was a pandemic and, of course, continuing to lie about tests being available. (Remember Trump saying early this month, ""They have the tests. And the tests are beautiful. Anybody that needs a test gets a test."") So it was left up to the local authorities, such as New York and Washington, to pretty much go at it alone. Hopefully, the mostly voluntary lock-downs in New York will at least help stop the spreading of the virus and buy some time. Cuomo used the analogy of tightening the valve slowly before having to close it completely last week.

Yes, we do need creative thinking, but remember, we do not have a national stay-at-home directive. I suppose it is near business-as-usual in my home state of South Dakota. So not every place has ""overreacted"". And in fact, many people are underreacting, gathering and cavorting, knowing more than experts, and determining that experts are elite hucksters not to be trusted anyway.

It seems to me, that this approach would only work with the added steps of increasing our ICU capacity and supply of ventilators and other protective equipment.

Whether we are responding to an emergency that may last 3 months or three years it is a time to examine where we are and why we are so insecure. It is time to repair the damage we created. We are at the beginning of population decline and we have virtually eliminate dire poverty in our world and we can feed and educate everyone. America can no longer lead but it has more of the world's best and brightest and as little respect as you show them we will be happy to see them join us in the rest of the world.

Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of people die every year from auto accidents, smoking related illnesses, the flu, alcohol and drugs, deadly diets, gun violence etc, etc, and barely a peep is heard. I'm over 60 and was one of those smokers (with early onset COPD) and so am in a higher risk group but I agree with Katz and Friedman. Yes, because of lack of preparedness, their proposal has lots of drawbacks including a likey staggeringly overwhelmed health care system. But as Katz pointed out in his article (which Friedman did not mention here) that catastrophe would be greatly shortened as even we ""flatten the curve"" with a long-term, draconian lockdown the system is still likely to be overwhelmed but it will be so for a much longer term. Yes, people are going to die as people do all the time especially the elderly and those with ""underlying conditions."" To ""save one life"" is an idiotic approach to public policy and we better get used to the idea that saving even far more lives than that is just not worth the unintended consequences of a nation-wide lockdown.

So in two weeks we go back to work. For how long? In this reset we do not end up with zero cases in the non-isolated but rather a lag in their infection.

What we need to know is the percentage of a population that has been to any degree infected with the virus (and therefore have developed antibodies to it). Current swab testing only reveals who is infected at the moment of testing, not who was previously infected. Only from blood tests for antibodies can we determine the actual rate of infection, and the ratio between infection and mortality. Without this data, most of what we are currently doing has no rationale, no matter how many times government and health officials tell us ""we're at war,"" and ""we're all in this together.""",Reader Picks,Ohio

"First, there is no evidence that once someone has the virus and recovers from it they are then immune. It is irresponsible to suggest that, since it could be far from the truth. Second, the only way to solve this mess is with extensive testing. 80% of people get the virus from those who exhibit no symptoms.

"The only plan that makes any sense is keeping our social separation running as tightly as possible until we can below the rate new infections can be medically treated--no matter what the survival rate is with a fully functional medical system.

If we can't break the exponential growth with social distancing, we will have about 10% of 200 million people needing medical care in 40 days--about 20 million people. That is 20 million who can't get care. Until then, we need to pay everyone who has lost their job and hustle to ensure that utilities stay functional, food is grown, harvested, imported, and delivered. No evictions so our homeless population does not explode. Small business owners also need to be paid so shops can stay open with essential merchandise. The current plan to throw money at cruise ship operators and airlines is almost exactly wrong. How will those without work find food and pay for it? Our current unemployment system takes a few weeks to start to operate. Small business owners must be kept in business if recovery can be rapid. Every three days, the problem grows 2 times worse. Until the number of new infections each week is consistently less than the week before, our focus has to be on keeping us separate, fed, housed, and as healthy as possible. Nothing else.",Reader Picks,CA
"I hear Dr. Katz, but his approach has three flaws: 1. The horse is long gone from the barn whose door he?s talking about closing - the infection rate is growing every day because we failed to test from Day 1. 2. The approach assumes people will be able to stay home if they feel unwell - they can?t without paid sick leave and job security. 3.

"The Ioannidis-style ""herd immunity"" approach has a couple of problems. First, because this virus is not known, it is very risky to generalize how it will behave based upon experiences with other epidemics. Second, to get crude and crass -- but I have no idea how that's to be avoided when the kinds of things Mr Friedman proposes are proposed -- how many billions of dollars of GDP will you get per hundred thousand American fatalities? The 1918 Spanish Flu struck in 3 waves. The deadliest was the 2nd wave. Not only did getting and recovering from the Flu its first wave fail to confer immunity against the 2nd wave, there is evidence it made at least some patients more susceptible to infection and death, not less. We don't know much about immunity, antibodies, or vaccines for SARS-CoV-2. Without a notion of how permissive and pervasive we can be economically and how that translates into numbers of cadavers, we can't know if this would or will be a win. What is the tradeoff is 10 million Americans dead? 20 million? What Mr Friedman and what, implicitly, Dr Ioannidis are failing to consider is the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 might just be telling us our global economy is too fragile as presently constructed and needs to massively change. And despite the present President's wishful thinking, it's entirely possible that there is another pandemic like the present lurking around the corner.

"Mr Friedman: I have long enjoyed your books and thinking--but this time, OPPs! First problem: time horizon. With a 3 day doubling period, we had about 120 days to get to 200 million illnesses, enough for herd immunity. This also means that 3/4 of them get sick in the same week (the last 2 doubling periods), and will all be sick together. Because we have frittered away the first 80 of our 120 days from discovery, we only have 40 days to get the social distancing to push the infection rates down to a sustainable level. We need to get though the next 40 days and get social distancing established so we do not get overwhelmed. Perhaps 10 million American lives are in the balance. Once we have achieved stability (or just crashed), recovery can begin, getting money out to individuals who have lost jobs and small business owners as quickly as possible is probably the best way to get recovery going as soon as possible.",Reader Picks,CA

"Mostly agree. However, getting to ""herd immunity"" by not practicing social distancing means the number of those with the virus doubles every 3 days.

Given the 10% who will need hospital attention, there will be a need for about 20 million hospital bed with a sizable fraction requiring ventilators. Casualties just from lack of ventilators would be in the millions. Because most of the casualties come in a week or so, the shock to the system would ensure far more casualties.

Multiply the relative infection rate (vs. flu) by the relative hospitalization rate, and you have at least 4 times the number of hospitalizations vs. flu, which will overwhelm our medical system.

When the reactors didn't prove profitable, the reactors were dismantled--and the brown-outs didn't happen. Mr. Friedman will have to forgive me for being skeptical of any claim that sounds like a billionaire's fondest dream. By the way, where are America's old people supposed to be sequestered? In internment camps, perhaps? So that they can all be together to make each other's infections worse?

Similarly other sectors of the economy would appear to be damaged long beyond a few weeks, let alone a few months. So 20% contraction seems possible - a severe blow to many. The first three stages of grief are 1) denial, 2) anger, and 3) bargaining. While Trump vacillates between 2 and 3 now, after spending a few months mired in 1), his base is most likely still mostly in 2) because that?s where they like to reside, in good times as well as bad. Friedman?s approach is more a 3) since it might involve bargaining away lives in order to prop up the economy. At some point, the terror of accepting that things have been fumbled badly by Trump and his enablers due to stubbornness will lead to the enduring of the pain of the loss of thousands of lives, whether statistically significant or not. The acceptance and grieving phases will be difficult for mature Americans, more so than those for whom compassion is to be avoided, or denied. To be stuck in 1) or 2) is to live without liberty.

We in the USA could have taken the Taiwan approach of large-scale testing of people for the virus and contact tracing, but the prevarication and delays of Trump and his GOP sycophants prevented that less deadly approach. At this stage, we still would need the large-scale testing --which Trump has refused to support and lend federal resources to -- and contact tracing.

"Everything you wrote makes sense but so much is riding on whether or not individuals and companies act responsibly. Retail workers are complaining about lack of hand sanitizer and masks and many are choosing to report to work even if they are sick. ?Wages at Target start at $13 an hour, and employees often have a hard time getting more than 20 hours of work each week. Many are not offered health insurance through the company. All of which leaves employees facing a hard decision: If they feel a cold coming on, or if they were in contact with someone who was confirmed to have the coronavirus, many say they have no choice but to keep working.? The response by companies like Amazon is to hire 100,000 employees to account for workers who are too sick to come to work. ? Not all of the hiring is being done to simply meet demand. Employers are also bracing for when their workers get sick with the virus or are simply no longer able to get to work, and are planning accordingly. ?Some of our hiring is to manage risk, too,?

"I don't think that rushing to get ""the economy"" rolling again ASAP is wise, for either immediate public health or long term societal health. We need to take the time to learn from this crisis (and the other crises powerful policymakers have been ignoring for too long, such as climate change, our over-reliance on businesses to provide health insurance for Americans, and the ""deaths of despair"" that are shortening the life expectancy of certain American demographics relative to their counterparts in other wealthy countries). We need to be intentional about HOW we rebuild our economy, so we create a capitalism that actually benefits all of us and won't continue to decrease the liveable portion of our planet. For example: if, say in a year or two, we haven't improved the pay, benefits, and overall economic security of the home health aides to whom we entrust our elder family members, we will have failed horribly. If we haven't at least begun to create something somewhat closer to the mix of robust commerce and solid social safety net you so well explained in your recent column about which candidate is the true ""Scandinavian"" -- we will have missed an important opportunity to correct course.

I think many of the commentators to this piece are missing the point. Shutting down economic activities for months may create more damage to society than the virus which it was meant to contain. No question we are in a bad situation. Is it really feasible to suppress the spread of the virus by keeping workers home for 5 or more months? What if it comes back anyway in the fall? The idea of containing the death rate and resulting stress on our medical system by targeting the elderly and those with multiple other medical issues has a lot of merit. Those at greater risk should be directed to self quarantine and/or social distance whatever limits are placed on members of society as a whole. Thus far our strategy to deal with this immense crisis has been reactionary rather than strategic.,Reader Picks,SC

I?m 70 years old, and so I am advised to stay at home. As a retired person normally in fine health, if I knew that I was among the recovered, I could be volunteering in my community. More generally, I wonder whether the world could be mobilizing volunteers from among those who recovered from the novel coronavirus.

"Social separation and shutdown of public places and events was a necessary first step, if only to dramatically halt the habitual inertia of business as usual, calm the populace and buy time to assess the parameters of a largely unknown risk. Once the risk is accurately identified and assessed, it is possible to talk about phasing back into normal social and economic patterns, as Friedman suggests. What is holding us back now are the residual burdens of initial denial, lack of available emergency resources, undisciplined and uncoordinated public responses, and a popular mindset of hedonistic entitlement. In the midst of a known pandemic only in America would hordes of pleasure seeking adolescents be allowed to mass on public beaches while officials dithered, cowering in fear of denying profits to motels and beer joints. That happened this weekend. Beyond the question of whether Friedman's ideas are appropriate to the moment, the real issue is whether this very fragmented society is capable of suddenly reversing its entropic spiral and coalesce into a social mechanism that can provide a sustained, coordinated and efficient response to a serious crisis. The Republicans in Congress are good at throwing public money at favored constituencies. They have plenty of practice at doing that. But can they do anything else?

We must understand that in the absence of any credible cure or vaccine for COVID-19, the best way to tackle it is through natural immunization (if one happens to contract the virus) and to become extremely careful and considerate (as a society) to take all necessary precautions.

Studies in Toronto during the SARS crisis showed that self-quarantine reduced secondary spread by only 0.1888. Since COVID-19 has a R0 vale of 1.4 to 6, self-quarantine will not have any appreciable impact on the continuing spread of the virus. For Friedman?s (or anyone else?s) intervention to contain the virus to work, we must first set up medically monitored quarantine facilities for people to recover without spreading the virus to other people. To fight this pandemic effectively, the most important number is to drive the R0 (R-naught) number below 1, and we can?t do that without quarantine facilities. This is the most urgent issue right now: instead of putting people who test positive for COVID-19 in quarantine, we are sending them back to their homes and communities where they will infect others.",Reader Picks,CA
"I would have shared the opinion of the author two weeks ago, when the upsurge of contagion and casualties hadn't manifested itself both in the country where I was born ? Italy ? and the country where I live ? Spain ?, whose economies were by the way already strained before the coming of coronavirus. The problem is that the virus has a contagion rate of 2.5, that is, every person who get infected transmits the virus to 2.5 people. Furthermore, some of the people affected by the virus doesn't even manifest any symptom, so if you let people go to work waiting for everybody to reach the herd immunity, before the latter is achieved many of them will pass the virus to 2.5 more who, sooner or later, will transmit it to elder people or people affected by other diseases, that is, the more vulnerable. In that way maybe the healthiest people wouldn't seriously risk to die ? even if there are exceptions between the casualties that show that in some cases the people who die don't belong to the most vulnerable categories ?, but the solution we choose would actually be a Darwinian one. No, I don't have any available solution ? both the experts and the most responsible leader still navigate in the fog, as the author of the article well said.

"Those critiques seem correct. Some VERY rough calculations... If you assume that 10% of persons <= 54 yrs of age (roughly 75% of the population) get Covid-19 at roughly the same time and that only 5% of them need hospitalization, this seems to be enough to overrun numbers of available hospital beds by a large margin. 10% infection rate in the overall population is lower than most recent projections. A 5% hospitalization rate is a fair amount lower than reported hospitalization rates for age groups <= 54 yrs in a few thousand early confirmed Covid-19 cases (https://www.forbes.com/sites/niallmccarthy/2020/03/19/how-the-coronavirus-is-impacting-different-us-age-groups-infographic). /#19524b271fd4) That would imply 330,000,000 * 0.75 * 0.10 * 0.05 hospitalizations. Roughly 1,250,000? We normally have around 65% occupancy in our 920,000 staffed hospital beds - so about 322,000 beds typically available? Some early figures indicate that roughly a third of hospitalizations are designated ""critical"". Let's say 20% to be optimistic. That would imply 1,250,000 * 0.20 = 250,000 ""critical"" cases.

"I have a problem with this idea: ""?Those who have symptomatic infection should then self-isolate ? with or without testing, which is exactly what we do with the flu,?? Katz said. ?Those who don?t, if in the low-risk population, should be allowed to return to work or school, after the two weeks end.? Has this person ever worked in an office?! People come to work sick all the time, including with the flu, due to fear of losing their job or simply because they have too much to do to take 2 weeks out of work. Who would enforce this self-isolation? Personally, I would never believe that most of my colleagues would care enough about their co-workers to stay home for 2 whole weeks (this is the more likely scenario: they care more about keeping their job than caring about the chance that their colleagues might catch their virus). This is based on my own experience of working in offices for 25+ years. No one stays home for 2 weeks when sick - NO ONE - unless they are dying. Every winter I have spent many hours at the office trying to avoid others who come to work sick, and have counted myself lucky when I did not catch their virus.",Reader Picks,USA
"The essence of this suggestion is to just isolate the elderly, etc. for months or maybe years on end, in order to preserve the economy. Effectively that means we are not all in this together, but we have to engage in triage by sacrificing the elderly. While that sounds Trumpian, it is not the values of the America i grew up in. I have seen some reports that the elderly start at 60. So is Mr. Friedman prepared to be cut off from society until the government decides he should be readmitted since he is older than 60? Interestingly, Dr. Ioannidis' solution to triage the elderly does not apply to him since he is younger than 60.",Reader Picks,Alaska
"The current strategy is focused on flattening the curve, The reason for this goal is to prevent the medical services from being overwhelmed. About half the people who require hospitalization are under the age of 60 so if younger people were simply allowed to go back to work and school it seems likely that the hospitals would be overwhelmed with cases. This is not the flu. It is much worse with regard to the percentage of people needing to be hospitalized and the fact there are no drug treatments or vaccines available.

He make a strong case for universal, single-payer health care in the US (as in every other wealthy industrialized country).

Because 10% to 20% needing hospitalization becomes a very big number when a very big number catch the virus! Then the healthcare people get sick, and there is no room for any other critical care needs....2) This discussion separates people by ""less at risk"" vs. ""more at risk"" and asks society to choose who will live or die. Such a choice corrupts the moral fiber of society. It reminds me when some defended slavery because of the economical impact it would have on the economy of the South.

"Nice reminder of importance of considering options to avoid ""group think"". From where we are now, I see troubling flaws in the proposal that Katz himself recognizes but downplays. Namely, it depends on i) public compliance that is presently lacking; ii) extensive reliance on testing capacity not yet in place; iii) testing for post-infection immunity that is not widely available; iv) lack of thorough understanding of high risk groups and the assumption they can isolated. The conclusion that this approach would reduce the duration of the epidemic is undermined by these faulty assumptions. The irony is that Katz's scenario is already playing out and containment is slipping away before our eyes mainly due to a lack of effective national coordinztion and leadership.

"The Spanish flu killed 675,000 Americans, over 0.6% of the nation's entire population at the time. Yet, before the Coronavirus, most Americans had vague, if any, knowledge that we suffered through this pandemic in 1918. Compare that with the Great Depression, which a far greater percentage of Americans know happened and have some sense of its scope. Before the Coronavirus, if you told Americans that they could go back in time and prevent one or the other of the Spanish flu pandemic or the Great Depression from occurring, does anyone doubt that the vast majority would pick the Great Depression (and probably would not have considered the Spanish flu to be a comparable public catastrophe)? The Great Depression was a contributing factor to the rise of Fascism in Europe, after all. Of course, the Spanish flu and the Great Depression are history, and we know what their effects were, allowing us to make more fact-based decisions on which would have been better to avoid. We don't know yet what the death rate will be for COVID-19 or how badly the economy will suffer from broadly enforced isolation protocols.

I remember that Bernie Sanders was invited to give a speech at the Vatican on ""The Moral Economy"", a concept he has not talked much about lately. To the Establishment, the idea of a moral economy is unAmerican. The pandemic could be a turning point. For the future of America, the World and our small planet, I hope for a more moral economy.

"I understand and share the concern about our economy, but am not really comfortable with the proposed solution. Historically, the effort to minimize the spread of infectious disease focused on restricting the movement of those who might infect others, e.g., quarantines during the 1918-19 pandemic. In the case of the corona virus we have not been able to determine with any confidence who is infectious--due, at least in part, to the administration's ignoring and downplaying the threat for two months--hence the horizontal interdiction in which everyone is asked to self-isolate. But the proposed solution of vertical interdiction focuses upon isolating not those who are infectious but those who might be seriously infected--the elderly, the disabled, those with chronic conditions and perhaps others. Assuming experts can actually determine who is most at risk of a severe infection, and assuming that having a mild infection produces immunity (neither assumption can be taken for granted), I'm still not sure this is the best way to go. For one, it categorizes one segment of the population--those likely to be infected--as less valuable and more disposable than the rest. For two, while it allows people to go back to work it also gives license for irresponsibility among those who may be infectious, e.g., the students congregating for spring break in Florida. I do not have a good answer on balancing the economy and safety, but I don't think this solution is adequately thought out.",Reader Picks,Colorado
"According to CDC (www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html), the 2018/2019 death rate in the US from influenza among ""Medical Visits"" (a.k.a. detected infections) was 0.2%. The most recent figures place the Wuhan covid19 mortality rate at 0.8% among detected infections, suggesting that covid19 is 4 times more deadly than an average flu. However, panic can probably account for at least a factor of 2. Imagine if a similar panic was stirred during the flu season; many more (older) people, who would normally die at home without being detected, would be included in the CDC statistics and the flu rate could reach 0.4%, perhaps. Or, to put it another way, many seniors in Wuhan would die undetected without current panic and the rate could perhaps drop to 0.4%. And I am not even comparing to a bad flu season like 2009.

But in reality, the virus would probably kill, at most, around .01% of the population, which looks to be the end result in Italy, so it's really more like 200 jobs lost for each life saved. And of course, that's ignoring the possibility that these quarantines might be 100% ineffective, in which case we've destroyed 5 million or more jobs for absolutely no reason at all.

Most physicians in the US have practiced in a context of abundance and are panicking in advance, such that much of what we hear from many physicians trying to invoke authority, is their own fears as people, or theories that are way above the pay grades of most health practitioners, whose epidemiology knowledge is at best a class in medical school. Those like the venerable Dr. Fauci, who advocate a lockdown are appropriately looking through a medical lens. It takes the rest of us citizens to apply nuance and balance the known and unknown from the medical side, against the known and unknown consequences of our current path. This article and others questioning the herd, are deeply needed and welcome. My sizable portfolio is a bit lower, likely similar to most of the chattering class, including politicians and bureaucrats. We do not lack for work or rent, and will come out of this chastened but largely unscathed. What of those who have or will lose all, if we do not resume economic activity.",Reader Picks,Washington
"If American leadership had acted on this crisis in January when first announced this may have worked. But they didn't. We can't even get our arms around the basic problems of adequate testing supplies, masks, gloves & gowns. As you surely know, any major problem requires a series or sequence of intelligently planned and programmed events. So far our government has openly demonstrated its inability to first, identify and acknowledge the problem in time and second, to provide the basic sequentially needed PP&E elements to control the problem. The pandemic is first a health problem and second an economic problem. But they must both be included, jointly and in tandem, in the solution equation. I believe you are correct that the economic parameters must be dovetailed with the health parameters so they work together. Although the emergency measures currently under consideration in the Congress are well intentioned, they are in effect being planned without sufficient data to intertwine them with the fluctuations and possible corrective variances in the health problem. In reality, sadly, as an nation we are shooting from the hip, and in total darkness. Our health and economic professionals have demonstrated from day one that they understand the problems and are capable of a planned solution but America's political leadership has preferred to take center stage and as expected, has bungled every step of the way.",Reader Picks,Florida
"The COVID-19 virus is going to be with us from now on. It will be in our environment and those not immune to it will become sick. That is reality. Do not be deluded into thinking that we will defeat and dispose of this enemy as in a war won. Once the infection has affected nearly all of us, the need for medical treatment for the seriously ill will remain but it will be manageable. For now, we don?t have the means to treat all who may need treatment. Once we can, then we can resume normal lives and not be concerned about causing avoidable deaths. It is likely that our economy will be affected deeply and it may take months to recover. Supporting people ordered to stop working should be our first concern. Then once people are able to resume normal lives to support the recovery as we can. We need to understand that at some point we will have to allow activities which will continue to spread this infection because we must live normal lives.",Reader Picks,CA

"I am in total agreement. The price we will pay in mental agony may be far greater than the pain caused by the virus itself. It seems clear vulnerable people know who they are and ought to be responsible for their own good health by chosing to stay home, not work or socialize if they feel they are at risk. But to tank a entire economy is totally disproportionate to the cost of saving those who have underlying conditions, are probably at risk for getting any number of illnesses and should protect themselves under any and all circumstances anyway. Yes, testing on a broad scale is imperative. But we have acted too extremely, too quickly, and in too devastating a way while making decisions without necessary debate. Surgical approach is the only thing that can bring us back to some state of normal and give us hope that the future will not turn into a nightmare.",Reader Picks,NY
"I haven't had time to read all the comments but what about the question of liability? College presidents didn't close their campuses just out of health reasons. My daughter teaches at a liberal arts college in a rural county with few hospital beds. If an outbreak of corona virus occurred that required more intensive care than the local system can provide, the patients may not receive the care they need. A few deaths of young, otherwise healthy college students is too big a risk for the college to manage; hence the hurried dispatch of students off campus. So while a more focused approach may be appropriate, the incentives at the level of individual decision makers and our legal system may not make that feasible. The lack of leadership at the federal level also makes it harder to try complicated, surgical interventions.",Reader Picks,Minneapolis
"It is simple. Like all issues that presents itself in science, one first has to identify the problem. Until we have adequate test to even sample the population as to the incidence of Covid19, we are poking in the dark. We had time to gear up, but our Federal leadership blew precious time calling it a ""hoax"", ""we have it under control,"" ""it will go away."" This is NOT about politics I am speaking, it is about leadership which is currently demonstrated by some of the best Governors in the nation. Due to this lack of action by our Federal Gov't we are in ""reactive"" mode in response to Covid19.

"?Confirming that individuals are fully recovered, truly immune, and not capable of transmitting is a crucial element in protecting our loved ones most vulnerable to severe infection,? Katz said. This is the rub: from what we understand now there is no assurance that those once infected and recovered cannot become infected again and continue as vectors of infection for others. How to establish with sufficient certainty that the 'coast is clear' and the recovered or those never infected can get back to 'saving the economy' is the question we don't have any answers for. Making that evaluation intelligently, and equitably, is going to take all the science, informed intuition and leadership we have. And, as others have made clear, we're not going to find it at the federal level.",Reader Picks,NY
"I agree with this targeted approach. An indefinite nationwide sequestration is neither economically nor socially feasible . A two or three week sequestration will give governments and heath care providers time to mobilize, delay the contagion, and focus on aiding the vulnerable. Warmer weather at the end of the three weeks may moderate the virus?s spread. Ultimately most will contract this virus and survive, so herd immunity will take effect, protecting the vulnerable.",Reader Picks,Maine
"Interesting piece, but I?m not sure I agree. I believe that Friedman and his experts are being a little cavalier, when they assert: [W]e still do not have a firm grasp of the population-wide fatality rate of coronavirus. A look at some of the best available evidence today, though, indicates it may be 1 percent and could even be lower. We have a population of over 331 Million. One percent of that would be 3,310,000 people! Even if you assume that only 50% of the population contracts the virus, that would still be 1,655,000 people! Even if you figure that ?only? 30% of the population (i.e., 993,000 people) are at high risk, a 1% mortality rate would mean 9.930 people would die, and since the mortality rate for those most at risk is not 1%, but probably more like 8-10%, that would mean 79,440-99,300 deaths! I don?t think that as a society we can allow such a huge amount of deaths to be ?acceptable.?",Reader Picks,DC
"What the heck will our hospitals look like in 2-3 weeks? Seems wildly optimistic to me. Think about this: People start commuting again. Car accidents go up. Workplace accidents go up. And we still have people recovering from coronoavirus (which seems to take quite a while from what I've read) and all the other usual stuff too. Do you really think our hospitals and healthcare workers will be back to something approaching normal in 2-3 weeks? Shall we look to Italy where things really ticked up, oh yes, 3 weeks ago? Cases are finally leveling off but their healthcare system has been driven past its limits. A healthcare system that is just as robust as our own, maybe more so. Rather than leading with ""We need to get back to work!"" which is something I totally agree with in theory, shouldn't you be leading with ""TEST TEST TEST! Where are the resources to make this happen?"" That's absolutely necessary before we can think about opening things up.

"Thank your for joining those few of us who are thinking clearly Mr. Friedman. It was clear that there is a HUGE difference in way the virus affects the elderly and infirm vs healthy individuals. The fact that strict isolation efforts have not been focused on this group is absurd. We'll crush the economy instead and play around with pretend-quarantine for everyone. The elderly will still be infected and die, albeit at a slower pace, and the ICU will still have to deal with large numbers of elderly patients. And please, readers, spare me your flatten the curve speech or your deeply flawed understanding of death rates or the situation in Italy. The coverage of these issues has been superficial and misleading. The elderly and infirm should be strictly quarantined in place now, with extensive support and services. The rest of us should adopt simple practices to delay exposure. The death rate will plummet and hospital caseloads will be drastically reduced. There isn't room here to provide the kind of detail needed, but there will certainly be more and more voices in the scientific community coming around to this point of view.",Reader Picks,USA

"The acquisition of 'herd immunity' in the population by removing the practice of social or physical distancing for the less vulnerable, was the 'model' adopted by UK initially, and which, as we know, was not effective. The goal of a more stretched out physical distancing policy is one: to 'flatten the curve', in other words to not overwhelm the health care system by an influx of sick and/or panicked people seeking medical care, during which the capacity to care for the really sick diminishes. More testing needs to be performed and more data to be collected to advance scientific knowledge about this virus and its potential to confer immunity. In the meantime, strict measures and/or lockdowns should be continued for the next few weeks. The government should provide financial aid to businesses and individuals who lost their job due to this.",Reader Picks,Texas

"Finally -- thank you for giving the important opinion piece from Friday a broader platform and more visibility. It is essential and even vital that the economy restart sometime in April or early May. Otherwise it is certain that the damage will be as devastating as the disease we are trying to stop. Consider these things: 1 - nobody knows what the fatality rate is. In the countries were extremely widespread testing has been done (Germany, South Korea, Japan) it is estimated to be somewhere between 0.4 and 0.7 percent. that means it's somewhere between H1n1 (remember that one? We didn't shut down the country for that) and something about twice as bad. Italy is not a good source -- they only test people who are sick enough to be treated at the hospital. 2 - We have a specifically American problem: it is clear that if we shut down for months on end -- maybe even a year until there's a vaccine, if there ever is one -- the economy and medical system will fall apart completely, tens of millions will be impoverished and homeless and without health insurance -- and more people will die ultimately. This is because in America we don't have institutions to take care of everybody in a time of national crisis. And all this while ""flattening the curve"". 3 - epidemiologists know a lot about stopping diseases. But the economical damage is someone else's problem -- this is why the advice we have been getting is good for beating back Covid19, but bad for the country as a whole.",Reader Picks,Georgia

"You are about a month behind the state this disease is in. First of all, testing everybody who might have it is not possible. People would need to get tested multiple times, so we are talking a billion or more tests just for the US. Also, testing does not cure anybody or stop infections at this point - it is a purely statistical tool. So this is a non-starter. It also achieves nothing -- the disease cannot be contained anymore, it is impossible. The solution advocated in this article: shutdown for two weeks to slow infections temporarily, stop wasting money and energy on testing (whenever somebody gets tested they risk infecting someone), isolate the old and vulnerable over the next year to protect them, everybody else go back to work so the country doesn't completely fall apart. Manufacture hundreds of thousands of ventilators and get ready for more patients. Anybody who is sick, stay at home and isolate yourself, don't go out.

We have NO real idea of how widespread the virus is. We can't go on in isolation forever--of course. But if we are going to have any chance of keeping the death toll down, we have to close the gaps BEFORE we step back from isolation. That means: -ensuring hospitals are fully equipped with resources AND staff -having an extremely large supply of PCR or equivalent tests available and all resources needed to run them quickly, as well as a plan in place for testing even mildly symptomatic people. -having an antibody test (there are none in the US yet) up and running so we can figure out who really HAS been exposed and has acquired immunity , as well as a better understanding of acquired immunity to this particular virus -having solid treatment protocols in place.

"It always helps to know the profile of a commenter as perspective is subjective. I am 67 year old, ten years plus heart transplant recipient, and I survive day to day by immunosuppression. So yeah, I'm a big target for COVID-19. I've already had my ""big break"" so I understand where I sit in the unfortunate echelon of medical triage. The proposal here might have been viable weeks ago, but that window of containment has closed. The idea of letting everyone be infected is daunting when there is no proof yet of how, if or when immunity presents and there IS some proof, albeit minuscule, of re-infection. And, without massive testing, which is clearly not arriving soon, we're left with asymptomatic and incubating carriers everywhere - including the supposed low-risk groups. What those many unknowns underscore is a frightening deficit in our knowledge of this disease and that should give us serious pause before making assumptions and false analogies. The idea of a horizontal suppression - as long as it is universal, thorough and enforced - is still the best short term defense in a raging, exponential epidemic. Past experience (the 1918 Flu) show that when communities did that, the survival rates were markedly better.

Essential services, including transportation and selling of food, would have to continue, as would most health care, public safety, and the manufacturing of medical supplies. Nonessential goods and services can't continue as before, since people are scared and are not going out and spending as they were doing, pre-pandemic.

"Excellent article. I had couple of questions or concerns to put forth 1. If people return to work after no symptoms for 14 days, it is still a possibility that they were only exposed few days ago and are yet to show symptoms. In spite of shelter at home, there is still a possibility of contracting the virus, when they made that visit to the pharmacy for essentials or touched a surface while shopping for grocery. There will still be a small percentage of population that might show symptoms after they get back to work. Even such a small percentage can grow out of proportion in no time like we just saw. 2.

Without testing, we can?t be sure how safe our communities are. Better to stay in place, let the Government figure out how to get aid to people so they can keep their homes, other necessities and eat, and not overload our health care system. When we have the capability to test a the largest community possible regularly and frequently, we will know what we are dealing with and be able to ask people to go back to work - safely.

In addition, employers agree to keep all employees and everyone returns to work in 10 days. I too agree that the saving of a relatively few lives is not worth the collapse of the entire economy which will take years to return to normal.

I believe there should be a compromise and team approach between the medical people and the economists. Yes we want to slow the rate of infection, but the reality is it's not going away, it will likely resurge and we could get hit with this or even another virus within the next year. Additionally there is a problem with our statistical approach to dying. The current medical opinion is that death is the enemy to be prevented at all cost in almost every case. This is not only patently absurd, it is not possible. death is the natural final consequence of life and if I die of this virus it is no more unnatural than if I die from an osteoporotic fracture.

"After stating 3 goals, including that we don't overwhelm the medical system, Friedman proposes a policy which would do exactly that: After 2 more weeks, let most of us, who are not that susceptible, go back to work, so that we don't suffer the increased loss of life that would result from tanking the economy. Nice try, but a bad idea, for multiple reasons. 1) It might work if we had a billion masks, 100,000, ventilators, and 500,000 hospital beds all available, but we don't. The threshold at which the medical system would be overwhelmed is quite low. See New York. 2) This particular strain is -highly- contagious; current estimates are that each case infects 2 to 2.5 other people. We lack anywhere near sufficient test kits, and carriers are asymptomatic for 5-6 days. This is new, so no one has immunity, and there won't be a vaccine for at least a year. Resuming business as usual would be an public health disaster. See Italy. I suggest that Friedman (and others) read Camus' ""The Plague"", in which a city first has to isolate itself from the world, and its citizens have to isolate themselves from each other. It's not fun, but it's doable. The currently stuck ""bailout"" bill, is simple socialism, socializing the losses, despite the current debate on whether people or corporations come first. We needed more of such socialism long before Sanders advocated it for health care, and we need it even more now, well beyond health care. Perhaps this too will shift the debate.",Reader Picks,MA
"Mr. Friedman speaks of our economy as something that must be preserved at almost any coast and in more or less the same form. It doesn't take an overly bright 6th grader to see it hasn't been working very well for the vast majority of our citizens. .2% of the people have over 50% of all the wealth in this country. This is a stunning truth that we brush off every time it comes and then muddies the water with talks of Socialism, Communism and Mao and Stalin. We have no health care system in this country for the same reason that .2% have half the money. It is worth pointing out that the other 50% of the wealth is also distributed mostly to the top 10%. The current panic is happening because the 1% that may die is much more evenly distributed. We will always have the rich among us, but we do not have to have the poor.

"I had this same idea, which I shared on Facebook. Responses from my friends convinced my this won't work. Even if the Coronavirus has the same fatality rate as regular flu among those who aren't highly vulnerable, and even if we could successfully isolate the highly vulnerable, our health care system would still be overwhelmed. The reason for this is that, unlike the regular flu, (1) no one has immunity to this, and (2) it seem to be more contagious by a factor of 3 times. So assume 200,000,000 people would get it, and 0.1% would die, that's 200,000 deaths. But, it would be worse, because the hospitals wouldn't be able to adequately treat all who needed it.

The reason to reintroduce public life slowly and cautiously is because no one yet knows how this virus works, whether it will recede in the summer, doubtful given it's activity in tropical climates and in Austrailia, or whether we can create immunities and vaccines to limit its spread at a later time.

Without knowing how many people they are likely to infect it?s not possible to estimate what the impact of this would be. Current estimates of the average number of individuals one infected person might infect are not know, but could be as high as 2. If so, each person that is released back into the workforce could potentially start a new ?chain reaction? where they infect 2 people before realizing they have the virus, and those 2 people will each infect 2 more individuals before they release they are infected, and so forth, leading to a new ?exponential increase? in infections. The net effect of this can be mathematically modeled, but the models require accurate estimates of transmission rate and mortality.

Very few of us can go months without a paycheck, and the pittance offered by the federal government won't fill that hole. In the meanwhile, we seem to be watching our economy collapse. As Friedman points out, that will probably lead to more deaths than the virus itself in the form of suicides, drug overdoses, alcoholism, and homelessness. The two-week plan offered by Friedman might work in a perfect world with universal healthcare, ample testing kits, and a president who isn't a bloviating clown. But we don't have that. In another perfect world, where people had limitless food, medicine, and patience, the long-term sequester would probably work too. But that world doesn't exist either. My guess is that we're going to end up with a grim reality somewhere in the middle, with Americans eventually going out, getting sick, and some dying. The vast majority will survive.

Thus, the Governors are instituting their own fragmented approaches to respond to this public health emergency and to protect the residents of their respective states in the absence of a coordinated federal programs or policies and in the absence of a federal scientific task force producing and sharing information with all stakeholders to make informed and cost-effective decisions. The President's spending plan for 2021 included a 16 percent reduction in CDC funding from the 2020 spending levels. This is on top of decades long continual reduction in funding for governmental public health programs in federal, state, and local level over the years. What we are observing today clearly is the absence of a national public health infrastructure (masks, ventilators, hospital beds, coordinated public health emergency action plans, programs or policies). This stems from the anti-government (anti-public health) policies of, primarily the GOP, and other policy makers and political leaders who supported them and the citizens who elected them to the office in the first place.",Reader Picks,USA
"OK, Mr. Friedman, we hear you but how to make certain that all of our citizens (and non-citizens) self-quarantine for a period of two weeks, excluding only our health workers and those who are already in quarantine at medical facilities? Mobile testing and temperature-check systems sound like reasonable ideas but where will they be located and how will we ensure that everyone makes use of them once their period of quarantine is over? I wish that at such a time as this all Americans could be pressured into doing the right thing, for themselves as well as for the rest of us. And yet we're a nation of people who didn't fully trust their government even before a pathological liar was elected to the highest office in the land. And those self-styled libertarians who reside mostly in rural areas far from the presence of government ""intrusion,"" what are the chances that they will self-isolate, at least to the extent that they haven't done so for all of their adult lives?

Would you want your loved ones pushed out the door knowing that, if they got sick, there would be no one available to care for them and they would be left to die alone and untreated? Didn't think so. We should be talking and planning now but to think this will pass and it will be business as usual in 2-3 weeks is simply wishful thinking.

But as I recall, Katz points to South Korea as an example of the 1 percent fatality rate. He claims this is because of good healthcare practices and widespread testing. But South Korea also has a much healthier population than the U.S. South Korea has much lower rates of obesity and significantly greater longevity than the U.S. (three or four years longer).

The question is, if the first step of two week quarantine is not possible, how should all the other steps be modified in order to preserve both public health and economy.

A massive stimulus plan centered on helping workers keep their jobs and small businesses stay afloat. Universal paid sick leave. Guarantee that if one loses insurance coverage due to a layoff, then they and their dependents are immediately enrolled in a basic ACA plan, with option to buy up if they want/can.

For example, Jared Kushner's team has no business in any part of this discussion, unless they want to collectively volunteer as test dummies for one of their suggested cures. So, while this op-ed piece has merit, it's a huge stretch to believe that Trump would allow another pivot, or is capable of understanding the ""hunch"" required to make the pivot.

So this idea would allow the 80% to become infected, get well, and get back to work, while the 20% remains sheltered from infection.

Maybe its wishful thinking, but I fail to see how a 2 trillion dollar stimulus if handled correctly can't do a lot to support the economy and avoid a serious recession.

"The reason to shut down is to prevent the healthcare system from being overwhelmed. If it is overwhelmed, there won?t be enough beds or ventilators to perform life saving surgeries for cancer patients, perform open heart surgery for heart attack patients etc and so not only will 1 million deaths occur from Coronavirus but millions more will occur from all the other diseases that we can?t treat because there won?t be any capacity to do so. However, if this shutdown goes on for a year, many will lose their jobs and many will die from not being able to pay for healthcare and choosing against getting treated at all. So, to optimize our situation, to find the best possible option among all bad options, we need to find a way to get people back into the economy while minimizing the spread of the virus. To do that, we will need to get our infection control doctors who understand viral transmission to group hack with restaurant owners and hoteliers and airline people to figure out a way for people to gather together safely. What if everybody just wore fresh robes and masks to the movie theater? Then put them in a hamper to be laundered before and after? same with airlines? The virus is spread by contacting high touch surfaces and the touching ones eyes or mouth or nose....so let?s figure out a way to block that!

For example, imagine a nursing home where all of the staff have already had the virus and are fully recovered, and pose no threat to their patients.

"Here is a quick back-of-the-envelope calculation. If the US population is 327 million people and it cost $1,000 per Covid-19 test, that would be $327 billion dollars. And the pandemic would be able to be squelched in a matter of several weeks because we would know exactly who is infected and isolate them or treat them until the disease ran its course. The economy would go forward; the uninfected could go on with their lives. And $320 billion is much less that the rescue bills that Congress is proposing which may exceed $1 trillion. Yet, of course, it doesn?t cost $1,000 per test, and we wouldn?t have to test anything like every man, woman, and child. South Korea, whose example is wonderfully relevant as they had their first episode on the same days as ours, January 19th, is way ahead of us on testing and public health spending. And their Covid-19 case numbers are receding already. They had learned from the pandemics of SARS (2003) and MERS (2015) while we were seemingly unlearning those lessons.

"Correct, we would need episodic testing so that the infection to detection interval is less that the infection to transmission interval. You want to cut the effective R0 from 2.3 without testing, to something less than 1.0 by reducing the number of days infected people are walking around. It takes some time for viral load to build up to maximum transmissibility and I believe you can get a test detection before you are infectious, but even if not stopping infected people from interacting for two weeks - or longer - will slash the transmission rate.

Trumps's Dr. Fauci is in the same boat, fanning the flames of fear about the worst case possibilities of the virus. Dr. Fauci also does not care about killing the economy to battle a virus that might ultimately be no worse than a strong flu.

"Here is a high-level idea to get society back to normalcy. With the approval of Cepheid?s rapid test and the potential for drug treatment of COVID-19, I think there is an opportunity to get herd immunity without overwhelming the healthcare system or sustaining unacceptable mortality rates. Outline: Set up large numbers of while-you-wait testing site, coupled with mobile units for hard to reach populations, where people with symptoms can get tested. Once the clinics are set up, slowly allow the population to get back to normal activities (the rate of restriction abatement would need to be modeled carefully so as not to overwhelm the system) When someone tests positive at the while-you-wait clinic, provide them with a first line treatment (e.g. hydroxycloroquine + azithromycin) and home isolation for 14 days. The non-responders would be admitted to the hospital and given more potent antivirals (remdesivir IV) and/or IL-1/IL-6 inhibitors. Clearly, treatment efficacy and testing/drug availability must be high for this to work but I think we have a path to get herd immunity and not wait for a vaccine.",Reader Picks,CA
"Thomas Friedman, do you even read the newspaper that you publish your stories in? Young people are making up 40% of those who are taking up hospital beds in NYC.

And medical staff are being asked to make their own masks (not medical grade) and come out of retirement to help. If you want to save the economy-- then stop this virus in its tracks.

My dad is 74-years old, suffers from COPD and diabetes. We don't need the entire economy to shut down to protect him. We don't need every child in America to be out of school.

The 1 percentage fatality rate is conditional on enough medical resources(doctors and machines), and it already varies significantly among countries. For example, in Italy, the fatality rate is as high as 10 percent. Even within China, the rate varies a lot: the fatality rate in regions outside of Hubei is around 1 percent and hovers around 5 percent in Hubei during some difficult time presumably due to lack of resources.

"Don't assume that infection will result in a significant immunity - even in the medium term: In Wuhan people who were cured (based on negative PCR tests) got re-infected with the virus shortly after with significant rates - up to 50% based on some numbers. What's more: Unless we have a much larger number base for who is infected / cured, the predictions come with an enormous error. Just letting the infection run its course and hope for the best is really careless. Also, there isn't a functioning vaccine against one of the other Corona viruses. Yes, with the effective containment of MERS and SARS there wasn't a long enough sustained effort, but there were attempts which didn't work.

Among the most critical cases, 12 percent of intensive care admissions were among those ages 20 to 44, while 36 percent were for those 45 to 64.? The USA is NOT seeing cases ?highly concentrated among those age 60 and older? as Dr. Katz hypothesized would happen here.

"None of these plans work without mass testing, both of active infections and previous but recovered infections. It is because of CDC's criminal failure on tests that gov'ts are taking drastic social distancing measures. If, like China and S. Korea, we could test widely, then public health could have identified family infections clusters and isolate them humanely, starting in late January. In the continuing absence of adequate test date, gov'ts have to act as though every one might be infected and close society. But even this is being done inadequately to be effective. Here in WA our governor is reluctant to enforce shelter in place and there are crowds in parks and beaches. This gives us the worst outcome: a shuttered economy with continued viral transmission. The fed and state gov'ts are failing repeatedly to take effective action, at the cost of health care workers well-being, unnecessary deaths, and economic collapse. Ioannides is not helping with his non-reality based statistics polemic; let him volunteer in Stanford's ER where his colleagues struggle with the reality of covid daily. Katz's armchair finger-wagging also is meaningless in the absence of mass testing and serious gov't action. In their absence, the reality is that we will experience waves of infection, distancing, tentative re-opening, another wave, etc until a vaccine is widely available.

"Two things are most urgent now in terms of shutting down the virus and opening up social and economic functioning. The first is this: determining with a much higher degree of accuracy what the fatality rate is for those who contract the disease. We just don't know. The best scientific estimates have been all over the map, from .025% (1/4 of 1%) to, in Wuhan based on early experience, to 3.4%. If the fatality rate is as high as .05% (one half of one percent), that's still much higher than the flu. The second is to do wider testing, for which we don't have the capacity at the moment. If we don't test a strong sample of the general population, how will we know if we are defeating the virus? If we don't know, how can we decide to loosen restrictions? In this regard, we are flying blind. We have restrictions with almost no source of information about the general population other than confirmed and usually dire cases. The third national emergency is to get ready, in case we fail, to ensure that hospitals and care facilities are not overwhelmed. Piece meal efforts won't get it. Nor will making more masks if they don't get to where they are needed. All hands on deck, every effort required. One report from S.Korea recently indicated that 99% of the cases are mild. If this were coupled with a lower rate of fatalities, the scope of what we face might be far lower.",Reader Picks,DC

Finally Johns Hopkins is doing great job on compiling data on infections and deaths worldwide As of a few minutes ago there have been 372,303 known cases worldwide and 16,381 deaths That calculates to a 4.4% mortality rate - which would be about 44 times that of regular influenza flu.",Reader Picks,NJ
"Dear Mr Friedmann - great article and good analysis by all. However there is one fundamental issue or concern that the herd immunity camp has not satisfactorily addressed. All numbers that I have been tracking all these days, if I look at the total number of deaths as a percentage of total confirmed cases continues to hover around 4 percent. Even if let?s say it drops to half that say 2 percent that would mean many millions of deaths in a country the size of the US alone just from one season of the virus. The herd immunity needs to do LOTS MORE to scientifically and mathematically sell the idea that if we take this route it will just be a very small increase over number or say flu deaths and not millions. Deaths in the millions from a single season is going to be a non starter. We need to demonstrate that will NOT HAPPEN if we let all healthy folks get back to work That I think is the challenging part of the argument.

So the citizens of the Culture normally use safer, slower, forms of transportation despite the risk being so low and the benefits so high. Relevance?

I live with an adult son, and I wouldn't consider this a sacrifice. He is a biolgy major and agrees with this scenario. There needs to be however, a way for either healthy individuals to leave a household easily, or the same with an elderly or compromised loved one. The two cannot mingle. Given the high cost of housing, maybe landlords can be subsidized and can cut the rate for temporary quarters until it gets better. Even a tax cut for providing this can be given. We should stay away from close cramped communal living for the younger ones for a while, as we don't want to force it too fast. But a reintroduction into the community may be the thing we need, while protecting the most vulnerable. This is all great if we are positive about how this will play out as far as immunity goes, Last I read it was still being researched.

Can?t we have certain people volunteer to get exposed to it, in order to become immune and start increasing the number of people that can go out and about to work, or to volunteer or whatever is needed? I understand first and foremost, our immediate goal is to protect our bravest and beloved healthcare professionals. But shouldn?t we soon start increasing the number of people who we know are immune(assuming of course that this means the can?t spread it at that point).. I?d volunteeer if it was determined I would have a very low chance of a dire outcome. I never get anything and have only had one cold in 10 years, have no heath problems, so I think I?d survive it....I agree with the idea that we can?t all stay home and kill our economy and stop living for months on end, we need a plan for phase 2.",Reader Picks,MN

"Every day I use Agile Scrum to manage projects at corporations; it?s based on empericism https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html Three pillars uphold every implementation of empirical process control: transparency, inspection, and adaptation. If all of Washington was run using the scrum framework the virus in the US would be as controlled as Taiwan and Singapore, because everyone would have listened to science, studied what was working, and iterated after small failures. Dr. Katz ignores empiricism. He?s like a doctor who barely listens to patients and then writes a prescription (similar to our president). While Dr Katz agrees the current actions are helpful for the next 2 weeks to avoid contact (but he doesn?t see not everyone is following the guidelines), BUT then he says he already knows the answers for what to do next - just go back to work and focus on those already sick or at risk. Maybe he should look at Italy and the rest of Europe right now, so he can see what 2 weeks in the future might look like and continue to evaluate our US status ongoing and not jump to a conclusion already. So it?s great to have a hypothesis (guess) about what to do in 2 weeks (and I would be overjoyed if cases aren?t increasing then), let?s not set false expectations now. Practice: transparency, inspection, and adaptation.",Reader Picks,RI
"I agree that that medical and biological preparedness is just as important as preparedness for hurricanes and other localized disasters. FEMA was established to deal with the latter. Presently the US or the world, for that matter, does not have a mechanism to deal with the former. We cannot expect private medical institutions that depend on economic efficiency in order to thrive in a capitalistic system to set aside enough resources, at their own expense, to address a situation that may not materialize. It is the function of government to either have those resources available or to require others, as part of doing business to have the records available.",Reader Picks,MA

"Indeed. Any thought on not shutting everything and everybody for an indefinite period of time deserves attention, and that 'indefiniteness' is the mainstream opinion today, not unreasonably. Apparently, a selection based on who and why will not work in the most affected cities but there are large areas of US where measures as 'complete halt' may substantially backfire. Besides, we simply cannot allow our economy to come to a complete halt for a long period of time. That will amount to a death by other means, for all intents and purposes. If necessary, we would go out and about with gloves and masks. If that massive testing ever becomes so easy and available as predicted (and let us not bash the govt for this, as it is a formidable task), so people can at least be certain about their condition, then definitely the idea of shutting every one in must relax.",Reader Picks,MA
"As you point out, to responsibly embrace a herd immunity policy, we need to have confidence that those who have been infected and recovered are thereafter immune and no longer capable of infecting others. What do you know of whether the tests, such as there are, identify antibodies? If we were able to ascertain that many, many more have recovered from the disease than we had supposed, we?d be able, surely, to time wholesale economic re-engagement with confidence.

"I think Friedman, and the prescriptions of David Katz, are spot on. The data need to be examined carefully and updated regularly as we learn more, but what seems to be overwhelmingly evident at this point, from the Diamond Princess cruise ship result, from Italian autopsy results, from the data coming from South Korea, Hong Kong, and Singapore, is that Coronavirus is extremely dangerous for the old and younger people with compromised immune systems or certain preexisting conditions. Those groups of people should be isolated and cared for and supported financially through this crisis. Younger healthy people need to keep the economy running. We need to expand testing dramatically, including the antibody testing to see who is immune, and to see more comprehensive data. But Friedman is right, we are very likely to do more long-term damage to America by shutting the economy down for too long than what is likely to be the impact from the Coronavirus.",Reader Picks,Washington
"The real question is what is the endgame here? In the beginning Dr Faucci and others were championing social distancing and quarantine as a means to bending and flattening the curve. But as states like NY and California increasingly begin to give up on testing for covid-19 except for those who are critically ill and who?s management might be altered by confirmation of disease, the numbers being collected are become meaningless. Ie. At this point how would we know if we are truly bending the curve or not? The chance for mitigation has come and gone due to the failures of the Trump administration. All we can do now is accept the fact that most Americans will become infected and that many will die and try to save the economy and local governments from complete collapse ruin.",Reader Picks,CA

"Narrowly focusing federal money to rapidly expand treatment facilities, respirators, drug treatments, protective equipment and supplies for health care workers and first responding personnel would address the loss of life very quickly. That should be the first priority. The Presidential must nationalize the supply chain to make these fully available quickly. Second, support unemployment insurance and small business assistance to protect workers and small businesses who are most likely to become desperate or insolvent quickly. The massive losses to our real economy from these people will easily sink the opportunities for big business to recover their revenues on their own. Third, avail big and small enterprises of loans to begin recovering when the emergency is past it's peak. The Republicans are salivating with the opportunity to enrich themselves by exploiting the country into giving vast amounts of taxpayer backed borrowed money to their private business supporters by holding back money needed now, and it's a disgrace.

The information that is distributed by those in leadership roles has to be accurate to a fault. No more half baked ideas can be thrown out in an effort to placate the electorate.

You and Dr. Katz are both failing to realize that the exponential curve of the virus's transmission applies to the margin of error. There is no such thing as a mitigated risk in this circumstance. Even a 1% error threshold results in complete failure. This is why any targetted approach that doesn't err on the side of being extremely aggressive will fail. We've already seen this in action: It's why every failure to-date has resulted in our current situation.,Reader Picks,NY
"It's unfair to say we care about money over people, as killing the economy has real impacts on real people. A overly slowed economy doesn't produce and delivery as much needed things, too.

"The ideas presented in Friedman's piece are largely those of David Katz at Yale. Dr. Katz is a well-respected, thoughtful medical professional with directly applicable expertise in this area. To simply dismiss these ideas misses the point of Friedman's piece. He is clearly advocating for more expansive thinking about what the current response to the virus is doing to those who are vulnerable from a health perspective and those who are vulnerable from an economic perspective. Have we reached a point in our polarized society where we can't even explore different approaches to unparalleled problems?",Reader Picks,NY

"There are two parts to this piece - an observation that we need to rethink the current total lockdown approach, and a discussion of some alternative approaches. The former should be a subject of the national discourse. We are facing some tough decisions and should apply a risk-management based approach. It needs to strike a balance between the economic harm - which is tangible, certain, and will likely be massive - and danger to people?s lives from the virus epidemic, which is currently based on projections and models fed by a small and incomplete data sets that makes them unreliable and spread all over the spectrum from minor to catastrophic. Medical professionals and epidemiological models, who are dominating the public attention, are focusing on saving lives endangered by infections. That is good, but it is only one aspect of the problem. Economy affects everybody, its prolonged disruption is certain to endanger the livelihood of many. We as a society need to discuss and prudently weigh the potential harm from each, and devise a considered balance between the two evils that will hurt less. Total lockdown is not that balance.",Reader Picks,CA
"Yeouch! Scorching-hot criticism. It fits and is thus highly defensible, but we all speak from our silo, don't we? Yours may be bigger, broader, and deeper than most, but all of them are limited. Above all, we want to make sure that we survive and thrive, if possible; then, and only then, can others crowd onto the island, but their visas are temporary: ""Only mine has no expiration date,"" says Everyman. Arguments are interminable. Don't billionaires have the right to their own money? But who needs all that cash? Answer: nobody; they just want it. Should we tax them out of existence? Would such maneuvers damage economic growth? Depends upon whom you ask. When people, weakened already, feel threatened, it gets ugly fast.

Don't get expectations up, and then have to force compliance. Yet, don't say we know we will be shut down for 4 months or longer. We can watch China and see what happens there for the next 10 days.

"A public health plan should be the first order of business not an eye toward quickly resuming the economy. Fixing the economy will take massive sequential stimulus on a parallel track with the medical issues but the economy can always be fixed whereas death can't. from The Guardian (UK version) ""What is the mortality rate of the new coronavirus? It is probably about or a bit less than 1%. Much higher figures have been flying about, but the chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, is one of those who believes it will prove to be 1% or lower. The World Health Organization?s director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, talked of 3.4%, but his figure was calculated by dividing the number of deaths by the number of officially confirmed cases. We know there are many more mild cases that do not get to hospital and are not being counted, which would bring the mortality rate significantly down. Deaths are highest in the elderly, with very low rates among younger people, although medical staff who treat patients and get exposed to a lot of virus are thought to be more at risk. But even among the over-80s, 90% will recover."" Losing even 10% of those infected over 80 is unacceptable. The economy can wait.",Reader Picks,CA
"Appreciate your concerns, but the best way to keep the base of the economy ready to spring back to life is to put money in the hands of all the people laid off so they can eat and pay rent. We don't need to save bankers and cruise ship lines and airlines. If something called United Air Lines ceases to exist, all the planes and people who know how to fly them will still be there, and we can reorganize all of that into a functioning air travel system. hmmmm Maybe the employees could own the new airline company. Couldn't do worse than, let's say, Boeing.

"Yeah, sure, we'll probably do something like this. This is America. Americans won't stay in their houses for much more than another six weeks at most. And it would be great if we could quickly test and evaluate 250 million people for immunity. I doubt that we can do that. And if we had test kits and masks and ventilators, we wouldn't be in this crisis. But we didn't prepare for a pandemic before and there is no evidence that we have the leadership to manage a graceful, safe restart of normal social interaction in the future. But we will attempt it. If the death toll is high, we will accept it. The stock market will stabilize, Trump will claim credit, and we'll get another poll telling us that 55% of Americans approve of the way he has handled the crisis. Sigh.",Reader Picks,IL

That's true even when the unit of risk is a human life, possibly one's own, and the stakes cannot be higher. The basic standard needs to be ""the greatest good for the greatest number"" and we must recognise that at some level extreme economic dislocation will cause more suffering and death than Covid-19.

"I like the philosophy expressed here, but (you knew there had to be a 'but') I think we need two things first. Number One: we don't really need to determine who has the virus, we need to determine who HAD it. We need a test that measures whether we have the anti-bodies to the virus, immunity, a serological test. If you HAD it, you don't have to worry about getting it or giving it. So we can all get back to work. And we can help others, especially the most vulnerable. The test would have to be widely available, ideally OTC at the local pharmacy. Number Two: we need a real President. A real leader. One who doesn't yell at a reporter when asked, ""Mr. President, what would you say to all the Americans who are worried and anxious?"" A president who could at least go one day without bragging about ""China"", a president who doesn't make the experts (Dr Fauci) cringe.

"Yet the latest figures show most coronavirus hospital beds are taken up by people under 60. Is it really feasible to only protect the over 65's given that statistic?

"So basically Friedman has formed a position and found a limited supply of credible sounding opinions that support it, when what he?s really saying is that he doesn?t understand the current challenge and that if he does, he thinks the economy is more important than a significant number of people?s lives. It?s not just about CoVid. It?s about All Cause Mortality. Poorly managing this pandemic will see America?s health system stretched to breaking in such a way that acute treatable conditions - heart attacks, strokes, asthma attacks etc - presenting at emergency wards will not be treated and preventable deaths will occur.

In fact, stocks and GDP estimates are already falling faster than they did at the beginning of the Great Depression. The Great Depression was much worse than the Spanish Flu.

And who thinks that people with broad expertise and experience are meeting to talk through long-term options considering the pros and cons? They are pushing through an ill-considered economic package to create the impression that they are responding to the crisis. It will waste alot of money, and will be guided by self-dealing and insider influence. Even at one trillion dollars, it will be insufficient to stimulate demand. While they are making a bad situation worse, and squandering limited resources to respond to what may be a huge collapse in economic activitity, it is useful to consider options for long-term response to all aspects of the pandemic and associated economic collapse.

"I don't understand this article too well. Maybe it's just me. The reason why I find it very difficult to follow is that as I write, I have learned from a family member in the NYC hospital system that they are getting slammed already; since he works in the ER, I take his opinion quite seriously and when he tells me that they are almost out of ventilators, I shudder to think what would happen if we just let out everyone and sequester those we believe are most vulnerable. We still don't know enough of who those are, how many they are, and how they can be accommodated if exposure to them is increased by not practicing social distancing and self-isolation. If this is an emergency as are times of war, then I argue that we should make some sacrifices (being with family and friends even in the comfort of our homes and via virtual connections sure beats dodging V2 rockets in WW2 Britain) and let the economy go for now. The projections even at 1% or lower, as stated by Mr. Friedman, over an infection rate of 40% (3 billion) is an unbearable 30 million dead in the world. AIDS by comparison has accounted for 32 million dead through 2019. It pains me to know that I may not have employment in the fall if this keeps up, that my 401k savings have been decimated by the stock market crash (and will become more meager as I likely tap them to make ends meet for the foreseeable future), but I am NOT willing to get back to what I had if it means that I could have prevented these deaths.",Reader Picks,Florida
"I read the original editorial and found it confusing. I read this now and still found it confusing. I don't get how this plan in actual application (with all the human error that is inevitable) wouldn't result in a situation like what is occurring in Italy. Add Trump's chaotic style into the mix and you'd end up with vast numbers of people getting the signal that this is no big deal and that it's ok to go to life as usual. How many 58 year olds out there who think they're very strong and healthy wouldn't just get on with their lives? Is that really safe? I think it's very dangerous to propose such a complicated idea and risk that in implementing it, the Neanderthals who run this country wouldn't make a mess that would then be impossible to undo.

First of all, I find this statistic both staggering and immensely hopeful. But how can, for example, there be no new infections in Wuhan, a city of 11 million? I simply cannot believe that the entire rate of infection in China is zero because they isolated themselves perfectly. There has to be some other dynamic in play.

"The data on the virus only really harming the elderly and those with underlying conditions is vague at best.

I say we spend a few more weeks with this mode of all being shut down and isolated to ""flatten the curve"" as best we can until we have more data.

That is the bottom line here--there are too many patients who need ICU beds and ventilators. Our medical community is upset, and not irrationally. When I saw a photo in the NYT of twenty backhoes in a pit desperately excavating for new hospitals in Wuhan, I knew this was not a run of the mill germ. That the press has reacted this way is not unreasonable. If our medical community didn't think this is a huge problem, neither would they. We are not all going to die. But, our medical system is going to be overwhelmed. Doctors are going to have to decide who gets a ventilator and who doesn't. They're going to have to work to exhaustion because there aren't enough medical workers. They're going to get sick themselves because there isn't enough PPE. That is the consensus of our medical community. Don't blame the NYT for reporting it.

"A national plan that addresses public health and economic challenges would give us all hope and settle much of the volatility in the markets. Picking up on the suggestions in this article, the following plan envisions an 8-week transition back to an economy that can sustain us until a vaccine is available in about 18-24 months. 1. National quarantine or self-isolation of every individual not engaged in medical or essential services for at least two weeks. After that, individuals should remain in isolation until they test negative for the virus. All individuals who have been exposed as well as those who are most vulnerable to the virus should continue self-isolation. 2. Federal incentives for private sector companies to produce and distribute sufficient personal protection equipment (PPE) such as N95 masks, tests and ventilators to protect all medical personnel, treat all Americans who fall ill, and allow healthy people to go back to work. If private companies cannot do this within 8 weeks, the federal government needs to step up and make it happen. 3. Zero-interest federal loans to all companies that need cash infusions to stay in business. These funds should be designated for operating expenses and for salaries. 4. Federal payments to all individuals without means of support because of the virus support, such as those who lose their jobs or whose income drastically declines. Let?s give this a shot ASAP. We can adjust as we go along.",Reader Picks,MD
"A lot to say but let's start with the blame game. Our leadership missed the boat early and often. As with most of his life, he thought he could bluff his way through anything. Perhaps is for the best it got this bad. Now for the reality check and what we've learned. We should learn from South Korea and Singapore. We should not learn from China, US or Italy. China, not sure they are telling the whole truth. US and Italy, different things. Lack of truth and lack of plan. The best thing would have been to massively test to build models of how the virus spreads and who is impacted. You could have focused the test on NY and Seattle/SF, whatever. A dense population of evenly distributed population. We missed 2 month by not learning but blustering. With that learning you can get back to work, school or life. You know what you're dealing with and you can begin to address the issue. Nature rules that every health calamity will have casualties. The reality is that we have a very important worker bee segment of our population who keep things running but are woefully unprotected. They can't afford to take a day or 2 days off because the have no safety net. None. So voluntary isolation will not work with them, because they still have to pay rent and eat. They have no medical insurance. Smart scholars and politicians should take this opportunity to fully assess where our weaknesses are.

"This 2-week strategy can be effective under the following conditions. Imagine a family member has a fever (top symptom of COVID-19). That person should get tested. If that person has the corona virus, then family members in the same home might be infected and should be tested. They will then know if they are infected or not. If that person is not tested, then everyone assumes that the person with a fever is infected. Hence, a family member in the same home might get infected at any later time, and needs to wait until the ill person recovers plus the ~10 days in which a recovered person can still infect others. There are 12 major COVID-19 symptoms (fever, dry cough, fatigue ...). https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/3/12/21172040/coronavirus-covid-19-virus-charts Millions of Americans are likely to have at least one such symptom, so many family members will need to self-quarantine for long periods of time, especially as illness symptoms spread within the family. For rich families, this is an annoyance. For poor families who live week to week, they will need substantial financial assistance. Without it, they will work while sick and infect others.

Nobody knows for sure, but there is no strong facts that it is above 1 percent. 3 - old and sick people will overwhelmingly protect themselves by isolating themselves. 4 - this is bound to happen because everybody is freaked out. 5 - there is nothing to indicate otherwise, and it is the case for similar diseases. 6 - young people are a minority of people with serious symptoms, and when admitted to the hospital have an extremely low risk of dying, many many times lower than an old person. If we wait for all the facts, until it's completely safe, it will take 1-2 years and will be an autopsy of what is left of our country. We already know a lot, and will know even more in a few weeks.

"I had read Katz?s opinion piece on Saturday (what Friedman references) and I agree with the ?strategy? to get the ship righted. Where I am horribly concerned is around the execution of that strategy. Executing it will require extreme COMPETENCE. Testing will have to expand faster than the virus and we are no where near where we need to be on that curve. I have very limited faith that the infected would self quarantine. China locked people up, Singapore does electronic monitoring and neighborhood watch. Are we going to do scout?s honor when people aren?t following the self isolation today and there is no paid sick leave? It also isn?t clear how a senior citizen's facilities are going to be protected. If random people keep going in and out of these facilities at some point they all become like the rest home in Seattle.

With 15% or more people-- including those who are not part of a high risk group-- who contract this ending up in the hospital, if we all resume normal life while this is spreading many more people than you're discussing will end up hospitalized, or, without proper care, perhaps dead.

People are going to die, and that cannot be prevented; how much money we direct toward the dying rather than the living is too much?

"I?m afraid that not enough is known about the coronavirus to implement an effective strategy based on ?risk-stratification.? Exactly who is and who isn?t vulnerable to life-threatening symptoms? People on immune-modulating medication? Are patients who recover immune? Can they still infect others? The UK wanted to go down the road of only shielding the most vulnerable, while allowing herd immunity to develop among the rest. They quickly back-pedaled. Furthermore, the timing of the outbreak was terrible due to increased travel heading into the lunar new year period. That exacerbated the consequences of the delay in actions and the limited testing. For an effective strategy based on ?risk-stratification,? global policy makers would have had to coordinate and ramp up testing dramatically in January already. The virus spread in the two months since then without our understanding of the virus improving at the rate it could have. It is still not clear how many asymptomatic infected people might be spreading the virus, including to the most vulnerable whoever they are. Bottom line, I agree that ?there is no way of avoiding the fact that many, many Americans are going to get the coronavirus or already have it. That ship has sailed.? Another ship that has sailed is that of using the past two months to build a better understanding of the virus to allow effective implementation of a strategy based on ?risk-stratification.?

"While I understand that this is a credible attempt at containing the damage from the virus and our economy, it seems a bit too naive. Let's start with the two week quarantine: even in those two weeks you are likely to get the mail (or receive packages), put out and retrieve garbage, and need groceries. Any of those things could expose you to the virus, even if you have groceries delivered. So each time this happens, you have to start the 14 day clock over. Then suppose that people at low risk for complications are told to return to work, but they live with people of higher risk, or they are simply out and about mingling with those of higher risk who have no choice but to go out. The latter can happen for a number of reasons, such as the need to get medication, or an inability to afford grocery delivery. And yes, my family is wiping down everything: the mailbox, the mail, packages, delivered groceries, etc. When we absolutely must go out we wear an N95 mask and constantly sanitize everything. At 58 I will wait for a vaccine and/or a treatment before going back to business as usual. However, I also don't want my 13, 14 and 24 year old daughters going out either. They are lower risk, but why take that risk? The truth is that we need to get more serious about the flu too--our attitudes toward flu are killing people and causing a huge loss in productivity.

Using point of contact testing with rapid turn around time, physicians can act on a confirmed diagnosis. We need to utilize both nasal swabs for the presence of viral RNA (45 minutes) and also venous blood testing for IgM, IgG levels (15 minutes). These tests are available and ready to use in every doctors office now (companies in CA and NC). Once we confirm each patient?s status; (actively infected, not yet infected, immunity achieved) the responsibility will naturally fall on the negative or immune patients to herd together and socially pressure those who have not yet tested, encouraging them to do so and declare their status.

Some of what?s suggested is already in process: pushing for expanded testing; attention being given to the extent of immunity after recovery; brisk work on vaccine development. (69 existing candidates are already being tested.) That has to be complemented by a wiser approach to income supports for the coming months. The two have to go together: ?surgical-vertical? public health leadership and better approach to income supports for the long term. I was excited today by reading Andrew Ross Sorkin?s ?This is the only way??: a bridge loan system backing a first stage flood of money to folks?not multiple cycles of floods of cash. (Sorkin?s sources don?t recommend the first cash cycle, but it?s necessary, while the public comes to understand the benefit of a bridge-loan system.) I fantasized that the legislation hang-up in Congress with Democrats today was that Sorkins? advisors? plan was the way to go, and that?s what they need to legislate. We need comprehensive leadership. Republican leadership can support Biden for 2021 in good conscience: Biden is a wise, tested, and demonstrably bipartisan moderate who knows genuine leadership.",Reader Picks,CA
"Al Capone operated a soup kitchen during the Depression that fed three meals a day to hungry, homeless and unemployed Chicagoans. Many thousands of people took their meals there. Al visited the kitchen regularly to insure that his guests were being properly served and encouraged their efforts to continue to seek employment. There is no evidence that suggests that Al ever benefited financially from the operation of the kitchen. He did it out of the goodness of his heart. I see nothing in the record of our current Public Enemy No. 1 that comes close to matching it for clarity of purpose and skill and decency of operation.",Reader Picks,Texas
"Like many others say, the complexity of this issue is well above my expertise. That said, the situation looks dire and epidemiologist and economists have to work together to save lives and the economy at the same time to the best of their abilities. It won?t be perfect. I don?t see a long term lockdown viable. People often say that economies recover; sometimes they don?t. And in the process, economic depression kills people too, at alarming rates and for sustained periods, just in a more invisible way. Weak economies destroy the health care system as well, let?s not forget. We need to be very creative and rational right now. I think Dr Katz approach is sensible and it should be attempted. I fear we have the most incompetent government however, which will make intelligent measures difficult to apply. That?s terrifying, I?m terrified.",Reader Picks,MA

"Fichtenkort Great points, John. We also need to institute random testing to gauge a better idea of total numbers exposed/infected and then the percentage of those who are 1) symptomatic, 2) hospitalized and 3) don't recover/pass away and then the ability to further breakdown by age, pre-existing condition, etc. This gives us much needed perspective and the ability to measure overall risk in comparison to other threats (E.g., the flu, auto travel. etc.) that we inherently deal with and accept on a day-to-day basis.",Reader Picks,IL 
"This piece, no matter how well-intentioned, is frighteningly myopic. Speculative statistics about lower fatality rates -- with the rest of the world in deadly chaos, including highly advanced European nations -- inappropriately minimizes the threat's scope, still amorphous.

"Predictably, Friedman places the economy over the people whose labor comprises it, which benefits, no surprise, the plutocracy. ?We would also want carefully to confirm that, once you recover from Covid-19, you are immune from getting it or spreading it again for a period of time. Most experts believe that to be true, said Katz, but there have been some reports of reinfection, and the matter is not settled. ?Confirming that individuals are fully recovered, truly immune, and not capable of transmitting is a crucial element in protecting our loved ones most vulnerable to severe infection,? Katz said.? How are we to separate Katz? belief that those who have been infected become immune to reinfection from actual conditions IN REAL LIFE? It is likely to take the months that Friedman risibly claims that we don?t have to establish that situation in fact. In fact, some patients might develop immunity while others do not. In that asymmetrical scenario, we will need to harvest antibodies from the immune in order to protect those who do not. There is no way to speed up this process, sir. The economy can be supported by a massive spending influx under the condition of keeping employees both on payroll and covered by health insurance. Then we will all have the wherewithal to pick up more or less where we left off AFTER THE MEDICAL CRISIS HAS BEEN SATISFACTORILY RESOLVED.",Reader Picks,NY
"The way that the government solves this is the massive infusion of money into an economy stopped by tripping an emergency brake. The way forward is to send money to businesses small and large to keep employees on the payroll and with health insurance on the condition that businesses must keep em0loyees paid and covered, and that those funds can not be diverted to stock buybacks, top executive compensation ( say over $5 million/year), or to companies still at work, such as Amazon.

"I respect Mr. Friedman?s thinking even when I disagree, but this column was different. It reminded me of an incident from 2009. During the ACA debates, a Boston-area-university economics professor wrote that his research proved the supremacy of individual responsibility: Some people and companies had to suffer for the greater good. A year earlier, a major publisher had released my book, The Spider?s Strategy. I?d argued for a reality that is now accepted but was new then: We are networked, not just digitally, but organizationally and individually. My online comment in the Boston Globe essentially asked, ?Will the good professor consider resigning his tenure to demonstrate how individual responsibility for healthcare should work?? Howls of outrage at my betrayal (I too studied business and held a doctorate from a top school) followed. Recently, the MIT Press and Sloan Management Review published my book, Leading in the Digital World. After researching what is and isn?t working in the networked world, I argued that when a crisis can move with blinding speed and spread across the world, leadership demands collaboration and inclusivity. Moreover, leadership today must pursue creativity. Mr. Friedman and the contrarian experts he interviewed ignore the need for collaboration and inclusivity. Moreover, their proposed ?some people say? path forward is devoid of creativity. Amit Mukherjee Professor of Leadership and Strategy, Hult",Reader Picks,MA

"The big hurdle is still the same: testing. My guess is that I?m infected. That?s been my suspicion since March third. The few tests we have are as good as no tests at all, in which case we have two choices: isolate or not. Once we have enough tests for everybody, then we can start to strategize the next step.

The daily onslaught of one dire outcome after another whether through the media or armchair theorists has jolted my world to the point of near hysteria.

I see the problem as cutting through the red tape and getting the word out to the people in charge i,e, the CDC, WHO, local and national leadership concerned with a remedy to this crisis. From the get go, we've been hampered by the lack of test kits, medical safeguards and the ability to address the severely ill. But given that some portion of the population could return to work and start to bring about some relief and most importantly hope it certainly is more than welcome. I think the most important aspect of the ""return to normalcy"" route is the collection of data determining who would be eligible and how is that implemented. Is this risk factor one takes when a leap of faith is implied? Everyone cannot be tested but if guidelines of the return to work population could be monitored so that the non hot spots are the first group to return it is workable.

"I think the ideas proposed here are interesting and could mitigate the mental health impact of prolonged isolation and unemployment that seems underestimated in discussions about strategy going forward. My concern for these ideas is that they require a level of precision, clarity, leadership, and cooperation that I haven't yet seen in the response to the pandemic. Additionally, this strategy assumes that a spike in ""low-rise"" cases would not overwhelm the health system because presumably the cases would not be very serious. Recent data shows that this disease is unpredictable and that it can be severe even in cases that do not fall into a high risk category. Until the data show that our health care system can support a spike of low risk cases, it seems irresponsible to follow any strategy not focused on flattening the curve. The proposed strategy is especially concerning because our health care system does not promote preventive care. People without insurance may not realize that they are immune compromised because they haven't seen a doctor in years. I agree we need to be smart with how the pandemic is handled so that there is a normal to return to. I also think that measures like continuing to work from home when possible and spending less time in crowds may reduce risk without having as large an economic impact as other strategies. Until people see the seriousness of the situation, though, I worry that any nuanced solution will not go far enough.",Reader Picks,MA

But there are other concerns over what is now happening in our nation.

While the ideas in this editorial have several flaws, it is nonetheless providing a framework for the future based on reason. To shelter in place indefinitely is not a solution, it could cause the greatest economic collapse in history. Any plan would be better than no plan. But I do have my concerns with this one. First of all I am concerned that, with the little information we have, sending the ""less vulnerable"" back to work could overwhelm the healthcare system. I am also afraid this may cause the fatality rate to skyrocket both due to the virus and the lack of services. Secondly, I am concerned with enforcement of quarantine and self isolation.

While I believe that what you propose is solid, it requires more cohesion and willingness of many Americans than they are able to muster. Its a shame too...this could be the catalyzing event that could help mend the fences among Red and Blue America as well as the younger and the older generations.

My hunch is that for every case out there that qualifies for an actual test there are at least five others so mild that don't meet the test standards. The death rate will likely not be much worse than the regular flu. The media also needs to do their part by not billboarding the anecdotal one offs.
